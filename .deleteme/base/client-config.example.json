  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What should I do in a plumbing emergency?",
      "answer": "First, locate and turn off your main water shut-off valve to prevent flooding. Then call us immediately—we offer 24/7 emergency plumbing services and typically arrive within 60 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I prevent clogged drains?",
      "answer": "Avoid putting grease, coffee grounds, and food scraps down drains. Use drain screens, and schedule annual drain cleaning to keep pipes clear. If you notice slow draining, address it early before it becomes a full clog."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I replace my water heater?",
      "answer": "Most water heaters last 10-15 years. Signs you need replacement include rust-colored water, strange noises, leaks around the base, or inconsistent hot water. We offer free assessments to help you decide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer financing?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer flexible financing options for larger projects like water heater installations and repiping. Ask about our 0% interest options for qualified customers."
