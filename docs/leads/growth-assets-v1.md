## Video Scripts {#video-scripts}

### Video 1: The Problem Video (2-3 minutes)

**[WHITEBOARD SETUP: You standing at whiteboard with marker]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"Contractors, you're losing six thousand dollars a month and you have no idea."

**Problem Setup (5-45 seconds):**
"Here's what happens. It's 7pm on a Tuesday. A homeowner's AC just went out. It's 95 degrees. They're desperate.

[DRAW: Phone icon with "7PM CALL"]

They Google 'HVAC repair near me' and start calling. First company? Voicemail. Second company? Voicemail. Third company? Someone actually answers.

[DRAW: Arrow to "COMPETITOR WINS"]

Who do you think gets the job? The guy who answered. Not because he's better. Not because he's cheaper. Just because he picked up the phone."

**The Numbers (45-90 seconds):**
"Let me show you the math that'll make you sick.

[DRAW: "Average HVAC job = $2,500"]

Average HVAC repair is $2,500. Right? Now, studies show contractors miss 76% of after-hours calls. Seventy-six percent.

[DRAW: "Miss 3 calls/week = 12/month"]

If you miss just 3 calls a week - and you probably miss more - that's 12 calls a month. Even if only half of those were real jobs...

[DRAW: "6 jobs x $2,500 = $15,000 LOST"]

That's six jobs. Fifteen thousand dollars. Gone. Every single month. Just because nobody answered the phone."

**Agitate (90-120 seconds):**
"And here's the worst part - those customers aren't coming back. They're not leaving a voicemail and patiently waiting. They're calling the next guy. Your competitor. The guy who probably does worse work than you but happened to answer his phone.

You're literally handing him money."

**Solution Tease (120-150 seconds):**
"What if there was a way to answer every single call? 24/7. 365. Even Christmas morning at 2am. And I'm not talking about some answering service where someone takes a message. I'm talking about actually booking the appointment right then and there.

That's exactly what I built. And I'm showing contractors how it works for less than they spend on coffee each month.

Link in bio if you want to see it."

**[END]**

### Video 2: The Demo Video (3-4 minutes)

**[SCREEN RECORDING SETUP: Split screen - phone on one side, dashboard on other]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"Let me show you exactly what happens when a contractor using my system misses a call."

**Setup (5-30 seconds):**
"So let's say it's 8pm. You're at your kid's baseball game. Your phone rings, but you're watching the game, you don't answer.

[SHOW: Incoming call, going to voicemail]

With a normal setup, that call goes to voicemail. Customer hangs up. Calls someone else. You lose the job.

But watch what happens with this system."

**Demo - Part 1: Instant Response (30-90 seconds):**
"The second that call ends, within 30 seconds - watch this...

[SHOW: Text message being sent automatically]

The customer gets a text: 'Hey, this is Mike's HVAC. Sorry we missed your call! What can we help you with?'

[SHOW: Customer replying]

Now look - the customer replies: 'My AC isn't working, house is getting hot'

[SHOW: AI conversation]

The system responds - and this is AI, not a person - it says: 'I'm sorry to hear that! We can have a technician out as soon as tomorrow morning. Would 9am or 11am work better for you?'

Customer says: '9am works'

[SHOW: Calendar booking]

Boom. Appointment booked. Customer gets a confirmation. You get a notification.

And this whole thing happened while you were watching your kid play baseball."

**Demo - Part 2: The Dashboard (90-150 seconds):**
"Now let me show you what you see on your end.

[SHOW: GHL dashboard]

Here's your dashboard. Every conversation. Every lead. Every appointment.

You can see:
- Who called
- What they needed
- The full conversation
- The appointment they booked

And look at this - you can see your AI is trained specifically for HVAC. It knows the right questions to ask. It knows how to handle objections. It even knows your pricing and service area.

[SHOW: Conversation details]

This isn't some generic chatbot. This is trained for YOUR business."

**Results (150-200 seconds):**
"Here's what this means in real numbers.

[SHOW: Analytics]

This contractor - HVAC company in Phoenix - they were missing about 40% of their calls before this. Now? They capture 100% of them.

In the first month, they booked 23 extra jobs they would have lost. At their average ticket of $3,200, that's... [pause] ...over $73,000 in recovered revenue. From calls they would have missed.

And what did this cost them? Less than $300 a month."

**CTA (200-220 seconds):**
"If you want to see exactly how this would work for your business, I'll set up a live demo for you. Takes 15 minutes.

Link in my bio. Or just DM me the word 'DEMO' and I'll send you the link.

Stop losing jobs because you can't answer every call."

**[END]**

---

### Video 3: The Math Video (2 minutes)

**[WHITEBOARD SETUP: Clean whiteboard]**

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
"Let me show you math that'll make you want to throw up."

**The Calculation (3-60 seconds):**
"[WRITE: 'Average job = $____']

What's an average job worth for you? Two thousand? Three thousand? Let's say $2,500 to be conservative.

[WRITE: 'Missed calls per month = ____']

How many calls do you miss? After hours, weekends, busy on another job. Most contractors say 5-10 per week. But studies show it's closer to 76% of all after-hours calls. Let's say you miss 10 a month.

[WRITE: '10 missed x 50% real = 5 jobs']

Now not every call is a job. Some are spam, some are tire-kickers. Let's say only half are real opportunities. That's 5 jobs.

[WRITE: '5 jobs x $2,500 = $12,500/month LOST']

Five jobs times twenty-five hundred dollars. That's twelve thousand five hundred dollars. Gone. Every month. Because nobody answered."

**Annual Impact (60-90 seconds):**
"[WRITE: '$12,500 x 12 = $150,000/year']

Annually? That's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Per year. Walking out your door. Into your competitor's pocket.

And that's being conservative."

**The Solution Cost (90-110 seconds):**
"[WRITE: 'AI answering system = $297/month']

Now what if I told you there's a system that captures every single one of those calls. Responds in 30 seconds. Books the appointment. All automatically.

And it costs less than three hundred dollars a month.

[WRITE: 'ONE recovered job = 8+ months paid']

One recovered job - ONE - pays for eight months of the service."

**CTA (110-120 seconds):**
"The math doesn't lie. You're either capturing these calls or you're not.

DM me 'MATH' and I'll show you exactly how many leads YOUR business is missing."

**[END]**

---

### Video 4: The Comparison Video (2 minutes)

**[WHITEBOARD SETUP]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"Other agencies are charging five thousand dollars a month for what I do for three hundred."

**The Industry (5-40 seconds):**
"[WRITE: 'Typical marketing agency: $2,000 - $5,000/month']

If you've ever talked to a marketing agency about lead automation, follow-up systems, CRM setup, you know what they charge. Two thousand on the low end. Five thousand or more if they're fancy.

And most of them lock you into six-month contracts. Some charge thousands in setup fees.

[WRITE: '+ Setup fees: $1,000 - $3,000']
[WRITE: '+ Contracts: 6-12 months']

You're looking at ten grand minimum before you know if it even works."

**My Approach (40-80 seconds):**
"Here's what I charge.

[WRITE: 'My system: $297/month']

Two ninety-seven a month. That's it.

[WRITE: 'Setup: $0 for first 10 clients']

Setup? Zero. For my first clients, I'm waiving it completely.

[WRITE: 'Contract: Month-to-month']

Contract? Month to month. If it doesn't work, cancel. I'm not trying to trap you.

[DRAW LINE BETWEEN]

Why the difference? Those agencies have fancy offices, big teams, account managers. I'm lean. I built the system once. I just plug your business in."

**Why I Do This (80-100 seconds):**
"I could charge five grand. I know the value is there. But here's my philosophy:

I want to PROVE it works before I earn big money from you. If I can show you results at $297, you'll be a client for years. You'll refer your friends. You'll upgrade to other services.

I'm playing the long game."

**CTA (100-120 seconds):**
"So if you've been told you need five grand a month to automate your leads, I'm telling you there's another way.

Link in bio. Let me show you how it works."

**[END]**

### Video 5: The Proof/Case Study Video (3 minutes)

**[MIX: Talking head + screen recordings]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"This HVAC company went from missing half their calls to booking 23 extra jobs in 30 days."

**The Before (5-45 seconds):**
"Mike runs an HVAC company in Phoenix. Ten techs. Been in business for 12 years. Good reputation.

But when I first talked to him, he told me something that made me cringe. He said: 'We probably miss half our calls after 5pm. My guys are tired. I'm with my family. We just deal with it.'

Just deal with it. Like losing thousands of dollars is just the cost of doing business.

I asked him: 'What's an average job worth?'

He said: '$3,200.'

I said: 'And you're okay missing half of your after-hours calls? That's potentially $10,000, $15,000 a month walking away.'

He got quiet."

**The Implementation (45-90 seconds):**
"[SHOW: Dashboard screenshots]

So we set him up. Took about two days to configure everything.

Trained the AI on his business:
- His service area
- His pricing
- How to handle emergencies
- When to book, when to escalate

Now every missed call gets a text within 30 seconds. Every conversation leads to a booking or a follow-up. Nothing falls through the cracks."

**The Results (90-140 seconds):**
"[SHOW: Results/analytics]

First 30 days. Here's what happened.

Total missed calls captured: 47. These are calls that would have gone to voicemail.

Conversations started: 41. Six were spam or wrong numbers.

Appointments booked: 23. Twenty-three jobs that would have gone to a competitor.

Revenue from those jobs: $73,600. In one month.

[SHOW: Testimonial if available]

Mike told me: 'I didn't believe it would work this well. I thought it was gonna feel robotic. But customers don't even know they're talking to AI. They just know we responded fast.'"

**The Cost Comparison (140-170 seconds):**
"What did this cost Mike? $297 a month.

Let's do that math one more time:
- Investment: $297
- Return: $73,600
- ROI: 247x

Two hundred forty-seven times return. In month one.

And that doesn't even count the long-term value. Those 23 customers become repeat customers. They leave reviews. They refer friends."

**CTA (170-180 seconds):**
"This isn't magic. It's just being there when customers call.

If you want results like Mike's, link in my bio. Let me show you how it works for your business."

### Short-Form Video Scripts (15-60 seconds)

**Script A: The "I Called 10 Contractors" Video**
```
[HOOK] I called 10 HVAC companies at 7pm last night. Here's what happened.

[CONTENT] Company 1: Voicemail.
Company 2: Voicemail.
Company 3: Voicemail.
Company 4: Voicemail.
Company 5: Someone actually answered.

Guess who got the job?

[REVEAL] 9 out of 10 contractors are losing customers every single night because nobody's answering the phone.

[CTA] There's a fix. Link in bio.
```

**Script B: The "While You Sleep" Video**
```
[HOOK] It's 2am. You're asleep. Your phone rings.

[CONTENT] You don't answer. Obviously.

The customer's pipe just burst. They're panicking. They call the next plumber. He answers. He gets the job. He gets paid $500.

You wake up, check your phone, see a missed call. You call back. "Oh, we already got someone."

[REVEAL] This happens 3-5 times a week for most contractors. That's $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 a week gone.

[CTA] I built something that fixes this. DM me "DEMO".
```

**Script C: The "AI Skeptic" Video**
```
[HOOK] "I don't trust AI" - That's what every contractor says before they see this.

[CONTENT] [SHOW actual AI conversation]

Customer: "My AC is making a weird noise"
AI: "I understand - strange noises can be concerning! Is it more of a clicking, humming, or grinding sound? And is your AC still cooling?"
Customer: "Grinding. And it's not as cold"
AI: "That could indicate a fan motor issue. We should get a tech out ASAP. I have availability tomorrow at 9am or 2pm - which works better?"

[REVEAL] This isn't some robot. It's trained on YOUR business, YOUR language, YOUR services.

[CTA] Still skeptical? Let me show you. Link in bio.
```

**Script D: The "Receptionist vs. AI" Video**
```
[HOOK] Your receptionist costs $40,000 a year. Mine costs $3,500.

[CONTENT] Your receptionist:
- Works 9-5
- Takes lunch breaks
- Calls in sick
- Goes on vacation
- Misses calls when busy

My AI:
- Works 24/7/365
- Never takes breaks
- Never sick
- Never on vacation
- Handles unlimited calls simultaneously

[REVEAL] I'm not saying fire your receptionist. But after 5pm? Let AI handle it.

[CTA] See how it works - link in bio.
```

**Script E: The "Competitor" Video**
```
[HOOK] Your competitor is using this. That's why he keeps getting the jobs.

[CONTENT] Ever wonder how some companies always seem to be busier than you?

Same marketing. Same reviews. Same pricing.

But they're capturing 100% of their leads while you're capturing maybe 60%.

[REVEAL] The difference isn't luck. It's automation. They respond in 30 seconds. You respond in 30 hours.

[CTA] Level the playing field. DM me "DEMO".
```

## Demo Call Scripts {#demo-call-scripts}

### Pre-Demo Confirmation Text
```
Hey [Name]! Looking forward to showing you the lead automation
system tomorrow at [time].

Quick question before we chat - roughly how many calls do you
think you miss per week? (After hours, busy on jobs, etc.)

Just want to make sure I show you the most relevant stuff.
```

### Demo Call Script (15 minutes)

**Opening (1 minute):**
"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before I show you anything, I want to understand your business better so I can show you stuff that actually matters. Cool?"

**Discovery Questions (4 minutes):**
1. "Tell me about your business. How long have you been running it?"
2. "How do leads typically come in? Phone, website, Google?"
3. "Who handles the phones? You? Office manager? Receptionist?"
4. "What happens after 5pm? Weekends?"
5. "Roughly, what's an average job worth for you?"
6. "If I said you were missing 30-40% of your calls, would that surprise you?"

**Problem Framing (2 minutes):**
"So let me make sure I'm understanding. You're getting [X] calls per [day/week], and after hours they're going to [voicemail/nothing]. And an average job is worth [$X].

Here's what the data shows - 76% of after-hours calls don't get answered in our industry. And the first company to respond wins 78% of the time.

So if you're missing even 5 calls a week, at [$X] per job, that's potentially [$Y] per month walking out the door.

Does that track with what you're seeing?"

**Demo (5 minutes):**
"Let me show you what this looks like in action. I'm going to call this number live..."

[CALL THE DEMO NUMBER]

"Watch what happens..."

[SHOW THE FULL FLOW]

"So in real life:
1. Customer calls you
2. You're busy or it's after hours, you don't answer
3. Within 30 seconds, they get a text
4. AI has a real conversation - asks what they need, qualifies them
5. Books the appointment right there
6. You get notified, customer gets confirmation

This is running 24/7. Christmas morning. 2am. Doesn't matter.

And it's not some generic robot - it's trained on YOUR business. Your services, your pricing, your service area."

**Value Confirmation (1 minute):**
"Based on what you've seen... does this make sense for [Company Name]? Can you see how this would help you capture more leads?"

[LET THEM RESPOND]

**Objection Handling (as needed):**
[USE OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE BELOW]

**Close (2 minutes):**
"Great. So here's how we move forward.

For my first [10/20] clients, I'm doing $0 setup - normally that's $297. And the system is $297 per month, month-to-month.

I can have you live within 24-48 hours.

All I need is your business name and phone number to get started. What's the best email for the agreement?"

[TAKE PAYMENT VIA STRIPE]

"Awesome. You'll get a welcome email from me in the next hour with next steps. We'll have a quick onboarding call tomorrow to get your business info loaded. You'll be live by [day].

Any questions before we wrap up?"

---

## Objection Handling Guide {#objection-handling}

### Price Objections

**"It's too expensive" / "$297 is a lot"**
```
Response: "I hear you. Let me ask - what's one job worth to you?

[Wait for answer: $X]

So if this recovers even ONE job you would have missed, it pays for itself
for [calculate months].

And we're offering it at $297 - most companies charge $2,000 to $5,000
for less. I just want to prove it works first."
```

**"I need to think about it"**
```
Response: "Totally understand. What specifically do you want to think through?

Usually it's one of three things - price, timing, or 'does this actually work.'
Which one is it for you?

[Address the specific concern]

The reason I ask is - every day you wait is another day of missed calls.
I just calculated you might be missing $[X] per month. Want to start
capturing those now or...?"
```

**"Can you do a discount?"**
```
Response: "Here's the thing - at $297, we're already a fraction of what
others charge. I've seen agencies charge $5,000 for less than this.

But here's what I CAN do - let me waive the setup fee for you. That's
normally $297, so you're essentially getting your first month free.

Fair?"
```

### Trust Objections

**"I don't trust AI"**
```
Response: "Smart to be skeptical. Most people picture some robotic voice
saying 'PLEASE HOLD' [laugh].

Let me show you exactly what it sounds like.

[Show sample conversations]

See how natural that is? The customer doesn't even know it's AI. They just
know they got a response in 30 seconds instead of waiting for a callback.

And you can customize everything - the tone, the questions it asks, when
to escalate to you directly."
```

**"What if it says something wrong?"**
```
Response: "Great question. The AI is trained specifically on YOUR business.
Your services, your pricing, your service area.

And for anything it's unsure about, it won't make stuff up - it'll say
'Let me have our team follow up with you directly' and escalate to you.

Plus you can see every conversation. If something's off, we adjust it.
Takes 5 minutes."
```

### Timing Objections

**"Let me talk to my partner/wife"**
```
Response: "Makes total sense. What questions will they have?

Actually - are they available right now? I can do a quick 5-minute
overview for both of you. Easier than you trying to explain it.

[If no:] No worries. When are you two usually together? I can send you a
summary doc and schedule a quick follow-up call."
```

**"We're in our slow season"**
```
Response: "Actually, that's the BEST time to set this up.

When busy season hits, you'll be slammed. You won't have time to
implement anything. But if you set this up now, it's ready when
calls start flooding in.

Plus, even in slow season - can you really afford to miss calls?
Every lead counts more when they're sparse."
```

**"I need to see it work first"**
```
Response: "That's literally what the first month is for.

This isn't a contract. If you don't see results in 30 days, cancel.
No hard feelings.

But if you're like our other clients, you'll see your first recovered
lead within the first week. Then it's a no-brainer.

What do you have to lose? Less than $300 to test it?"
```

### Competition Objections

**"I already have a receptionist"**
```
Response: "That's awesome - you're ahead of a lot of contractors.

But let me ask: What happens at 6pm when they go home? Saturdays?
Sundays? Holidays?

This isn't meant to replace your receptionist. It's for the 128 hours
a week she's NOT there. The average contractor misses 76% of their
after-hours calls.

Think of it as your night shift and weekend coverage. For less than
hiring someone part-time."
```

**"I tried something like this before and it didn't work"**
```
Response: "What was it, if you don't mind me asking?

[Listen to their experience]

Okay, so [problem they had]. Here's how this is different...

[Address their specific concern - usually it's either the AI wasn't
trained well OR the follow-up wasn't automated OR it was too
expensive]

Tell you what - let's do a pilot. Give me 30 days. If you don't see
results that blow away what you tried before, I'll give you a full
refund. No questions."
```

### Stall Tactics

**"Send me some information"**
```
Response: "I can definitely do that. But honestly, the info won't be
as helpful as actually SEEING it work.

It's a 15-minute demo. Can we find 15 minutes later this week?
I promise it's worth it.

[If they resist:] Okay, what's your email? I'll send you a case study
and a recording of the demo. Fair warning - the recording doesn't do
it justice. Let me know if you want to see it live after."
```

**"I'm too busy right now"**
```
Response: "I get it - you're running a business. Totally understand.

But think about it this way: you're too busy to take 15 minutes,
but you're not too busy to miss thousands of dollars in calls every month?

This is literally going to SAVE you time. Less chasing leads, more
automatically booked appointments.

What if we did 7am before your day starts? Or 6pm after things
calm down?"
```

## Email Templates {#email-templates}

### Cold Email to Contractors (Partner Referral)

**Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]**

```
Hey [First Name],

[Referral Name] mentioned you run [Company Name] - sounds like you're
doing great work in [City].

Quick question: Are you guys capturing after-hours calls right now,
or are those going to voicemail?

I ask because I built an AI system that responds to missed calls in
under 60 seconds, has a real conversation, and books appointments -
all automatically.

One HVAC company used it to book 23 extra jobs in 30 days. Jobs they
would have missed.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it makes sense for you?

Either way, keep killing it.

[Your name]

P.S. - [Referral Name] gets a kickback if you sign up, so if this isn't
for you, no pressure. Just thought you should see it.
```

### Follow-Up Email (After Demo Booked)

**Subject: Tomorrow's call - quick prep**

```
Hey [First Name],

Looking forward to showing you the system tomorrow at [time].

So I can make this super relevant for you, quick question:

Roughly how many calls do you think you miss per week?
(After hours, weekends, when you're on a job?)

No need to be exact - just ballpark.

See you tomorrow!

[Your name]
```

### Follow-Up Email (After Demo - No Decision)

**Subject: Following up from our call**

```
Hey [First Name],

Good chatting yesterday! Wanted to send over a quick recap:

## LinkedIn Outreach {#linkedin-outreach}

### Connection Request (No Note Needed - Just Connect)

Then send message after they accept:

### Initial Message (After Connection)

```
Hey [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Saw you run [Company Name] - looks like
you're doing great work.

Quick question: how do you guys handle calls after hours? Most
contractors I talk to are missing 30-50% of those.

Not selling anything - genuinely curious how you've solved it.
```

### Follow-Up (If They Respond)

```
Interesting! [Acknowledge their response]

Reason I ask - I built an AI system that captures those calls.
Responds in 30 seconds, books appointments automatically.

One HVAC company used it to book 23 extra jobs in their first month.

Would you be open to seeing how it works? 15 min demo.
```

### Follow-Up (If No Response)

```
[Name] - know you're busy. Wasn't trying to pitch you, just
noticed something most contractors struggle with.

If you're ever curious how to capture 100% of your leads
automatically, happy to show you. No pressure either way.
```

### LinkedIn Post Templates

**Post 1: Value-First**
```
Contractors: here's a simple tweak that can add $5,000+/month.

Respond to every inquiry within 5 minutes.

"But I'm on a job!"

That's what automation is for. AI can respond for you.

The first company to respond wins 78% of the time.

Speed = money.

#contractors #HVAC #plumbing
```

**Post 2: Story-Based**
```
Called 10 HVAC companies at 7pm last week.

9 went to voicemail.

1 actually responded.

Guess who would've gotten my business?

Contractors leave $10,000+/month on the table because they
can't answer every call.

There's a fix for that.

DM me if you want to know what it is.

## Partnership Scripts {#partnership-scripts}

### Cold Email to Web Designers

**Subject: Partnership idea - easy recurring revenue for you**

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your work with [recent client] - looks great.

Quick idea: I built an AI lead automation system for contractors.
When you deliver a website, they always ask "how do I get more leads?"
right?

What if you could offer them:
- AI that responds to every missed call in 30 seconds
- Automatic appointment booking
- 24/7 lead capture

And you get 20% of every client, forever. At $297/month, that's
$59/month recurring per client. Refer 20 clients, make $1,180/month
for doing nothing.

Want to see how it works? 15 min demo.

[Your name]
```

### Phone Script for Partners

```
"Hey [Name], this is [Your Name]. I sent you an email about a
partnership - did you get a chance to see it?

[Yes/Vaguely:]
Great! So the quick version - I built an AI system for contractors.
Responds to missed calls in 30 seconds, books appointments automatically.

I'm looking for strategic partners like you who work with contractors.
When you deliver a website, you can offer this as an add-on. You
make 20% of every referral forever.

At $297/month, that's $59/month recurring per client. If you refer
20 clients this year, that's over $14,000 annually in passive income.

Want to see how it works? Takes 15 minutes."

## Webinar Script {#webinar-script}

### Full Webinar: "How Contractors Are Booking 20+ Extra Jobs Per Month"

**[PRE-WEBINAR - 5 min before start]**
```
"Hey everyone, we're going to get started in about 5 minutes. While
you're waiting, drop in the chat: what type of contractor are you?
HVAC, plumbing, electrical? And what city are you in?

Also, let me know - what's your biggest challenge with getting
more leads right now?"
```

**[START - 0:00]**

**Hook (0-5 min):**
```
"Alright, let's dive in. Thanks for being here.

I'm [Your Name], and in the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you
exactly how contractors are booking 20+ extra jobs per month without
spending more on ads, without hiring more staff, and without working
more hours.

But first, let me ask you something: How much money did you lose
last month from calls you didn't answer?

Not calls where you talked to someone and they didn't book. I mean
calls that rang, went to voicemail, and you never heard from that
person again.

If you're like most contractors I talk to, it's somewhere between
$5,000 and $15,000. Per month.

That's the $72,000+ per year problem. And that's what we're going
to solve today."
```

**Story (5-10 min):**
```
"Let me tell you how I figured this out.

I was working with a contractor - HVAC company in Phoenix, guy
named Mike. He was spending $5,000 a month on Google ads. Getting
plenty of clicks. Website looked great. But he couldn't figure out
why his close rate was so low.

So I asked him: 'What happens when someone calls?'

He said: 'We answer if we can. If we're on a job or it's after
hours, they leave a message. We call them back next morning.'

I said: 'Mike, how many of those people actually answer when you
call back?'

He got quiet. 'Maybe... 30%?'

Thirty percent. Seventy percent of his leads - leads he PAID for -
disappeared because he couldn't answer the phone and they didn't
answer when he called back.

That's when I built the system I'm going to show you today."
```

**Content - System 1 (10-20 min):**
```
"There are three systems every contractor needs to capture more leads.
The first one is SPEED TO LEAD.

Here's what the data says: The first company to respond wins 78%
of the time. Not the best company. Not the cheapest company. The
FIRST company.

And the average response time for most contractors? Over 24 hours.

24 hours. By then, the customer has already called 5 other companies
and hired someone.

What you need is response time under 5 minutes. Ideally under 1 minute.

'But I'm on a job!'

That's what automation is for. [Demo the instant response]

Watch this - I'm going to call this number. It's going to go to
voicemail. And within 30 seconds...

[Show the text coming in]

Boom. Response. And this isn't a template. Watch...

[Show the conversation]

It asks what they need. It qualifies them. It books the appointment.
All automatically. All while you're on a job."
```

**Content - System 2 (20-30 min):**
```
"Second system: AUTOMATED FOLLOW-UP.

Here's what happens with most leads: Someone calls. You're busy.
They leave a message. You call back the next day. No answer. You
call again. No answer. You move on.

80% of sales happen after 5+ follow-ups. But most contractors
stop after 1 or 2.

Not because they're lazy. Because they're busy running a business.

What if you could follow up automatically? Text on Day 1. Email on
Day 2. Text on Day 3. Reminder on Day 7.

[Show the automation sequence]

This lead didn't answer for 3 days. But look - on Day 4, they
responded. Booked an appointment. $2,800 job.

Without automation? That lead would have been dead."
```

**Content - System 3 (30-40 min):**
```
"Third system: 24/7 AVAILABILITY.

You can't answer the phone at 2am. You can't answer on Christmas.
You can't answer during your kid's baseball game.

But your customers don't care. When their AC breaks at 2am, they
want someone NOW.

The average contractor misses 76% of their after-hours calls. That's
money walking straight to your competitor.

[Show after-hours capture]

Look at this conversation - it happened at 11:47pm on a Saturday.
Customer's pipe burst. Emergency. AI responded in 28 seconds. Had a
conversation. Booked an emergency call for the next morning.

$4,200 job. Captured while the contractor was asleep."
```

**Case Studies (40-45 min):**
```
"Let me show you some real results.

[Case Study 1: Mike's HVAC]
- Before: Missing 40% of calls
- After: 47 calls captured in 30 days
- 23 appointments booked
- $73,600 in recovered revenue

[Case Study 2: Pete's Plumbing]
- Before: Calling leads back next day
- After: Responding in under 60 seconds
- Close rate went from 23% to 51%
- Added $18,000/month

[Case Study 3: Maria's Restoration]
- Before: No after-hours coverage
- After: 24/7 capture
- 34 emergency calls captured at night/weekends
- $127,000 in new revenue first quarter

These aren't anomalies. This is what happens when you capture
100% of your leads instead of 60%."

## Social Media Captions {#social-media-captions}

POV: You're a contractor and this just cost you $2,500 📱❌

Every missed call is a customer calling your competitor. There's a fix.
#contractor #HVAC #plumbing #smallbusiness #leads

```
The math that'll make you sick 🤮

Miss 3 calls a week x $2,000 per job = $24,000/year GONE

"I don't need lead automation"

- Guy who lost $15,000 last month from missed calls
#contractor #HVAC #marketing

```
While you're at your kid's game 🏈

Your competitor is answering his phone and taking your customers.

Or... you let AI handle it.
#worklifebalance #contractor #automation
```

```
Contractors, here's a cheat code:

The first company to respond wins 78% of the time.

Respond in 30 seconds, not 30 hours.
#businesshacks #leadgeneration #contractor
```

### LinkedIn Captions

```
76% of after-hours calls go unanswered.

For contractors, that means:
- Lost revenue
- Lost customers
- Lost reputation

The solution isn't working longer hours.

It's automation.

AI can respond in 30 seconds.
Book appointments automatically.
Work 24/7/365.

The contractors who adopt this now will dominate.

The ones who wait will wonder where their customers went.
```

```
I called 10 HVAC companies at 7pm last Tuesday.

Results:
❌ Company 1: Voicemail
❌ Company 2: Voicemail
❌ Company 3: Voicemail
❌ Company 4: Voicemail
❌ Company 5: Voicemail
❌ Company 6: Voicemail
❌ Company 7: Voicemail
❌ Company 8: Voicemail
❌ Company 9: Voicemail
✅ Company 10: Answered!

Guess who would've gotten my business?

9 companies left thousands of dollars on the table.

This happens every single night in every city.

There's a better way.
