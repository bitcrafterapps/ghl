You would continue this pattern down to **row 200+** in your own sheet with **real companies** from your chosen markets.

### 3. How to Build a 200‑Company Target List (Step‑by‑Step)

#### Step 1 – Choose 3–5 Core Cities / Markets

Focus where you can realistically sell and support:

- Start with your **home metro** and 2–4 nearby cities.  
- Prioritize areas with **active construction and service demand** (growth, real estate activity, weather extremes, etc.).

Example: *Denver, Aurora, Colorado Springs, Boulder, Lakewood*.

#### Step 2 – Use Google Maps & Local Service Ads

For each city:

1. Search:  
   - “general contractor \[city\]”  
   - “HVAC contractor \[city\]”  
   - “plumber \[city\]”  
   - “roofing company \[city\]”  
   - “electrical contractor \[city\]”  
   - “water damage restoration \[city\]”  
   - “carpet cleaning \[city\]”
2. Open the **Maps results** and **LSA (Google Guaranteed)** boxes.  
3. Add companies that match:
   - 5–50 employees (estimate from website/photos)  
   - Appearing to **run ads or LSAs**  
   - Rating **between 3.8–4.7** with at least 10–100 reviews  
   - **No online booking** or clunky contact forms  

Populate your sheet with:

- Name, website, phone, rating, review count  
- Notes from reviews like: “hard to reach,” “slow to respond,” etc.

#### Step 3 – Add Yelp & Angi Prospects

1. Go to Yelp and Angi for the same cities.  
2. Filter by:
   - **3–30 reviews** (hungry but not saturated)  
   - Recent activity in the last 3–6 months  
3. Add companies that:
   - Are clearly **paying for ads or featured placements**  
   - Look like they do **higher‑ticket jobs** (remodels, replacements, restoration)

Fill in missing contact data (website, email, owner) by checking:

- The company’s website  
- “About” and “Team” pages  
- LinkedIn for owner/GM names

#### Step 4 – Use Data Providers to Scale (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Outscraper)

When you’re ready to scale:

- Use **Apollo/ZoomInfo** to filter by:
  - **NAICS construction & home services codes**  
  - 5–50 employees  
  - Geography = your states/regions  
- Use **Outscraper / PhantomBuster** to:
  - Pull Google Maps data at scale (name, URL, phone, rating, etc.)  
  - Enrich with emails & decision‑maker names where possible

Import that CSV into your main sheet and **dedupe** against existing entries.

#### Step 5 – Tag Priority Accounts

Add a short tag in the **Notes** column:

- “🔥 HOT – running ads, no online booking, slow response in reviews”  
- “Warm – mid‑size, good reviews, no automation visible”  
- “Later – small or early‑stage, still a fit but lower budget”  

Your first **50–100 priority companies** should be:

- Running ads or LSAs  
- Missing systematic booking & follow‑up  
- Clearly losing jobs to speed and responsiveness

---

### 4. Daily & Weekly Targets Using This List

Once you have your list built (or partially built):

- **Daily:**
  - 50 cold emails  
  - 20 cold calls  
  - 5 Loom videos  
  - 20+ follow‑ups  
- **Weekly:**
  - 2–4 demos booked  
  - 1–2 new clients closed

Use the **Lead Source**, **Notes**, and **Priority tags** to decide **who to hit first each day**. Start with the businesses who are **already paying for leads and clearly leaking them** due to missed calls and slow follow‑up.

---

### 5. 7‑Day Plan to Build Your First 200 Companies

Use this to get from **0 → 200 qualified accounts** without overthinking it:

- **Day 1 – Core City #1 (e.g., Home Metro)**  
  - Pull 30–40 companies from Google Maps + LSAs (all trades).  
  - Fill in: Company, website, phone, rating, reviews, city, state.  

- **Day 2 – Core City #2**  
  - Add 30–40 more companies using the same process.  
  - Start filling in owner/decision‑maker names and emails for at least 10–15 of them.

- **Day 3 – Core City #3 + Yelp/Angi**  
  - Add 30–40 companies from Maps/LSA.  
  - Add 10–15 from Yelp/Angi (active advertisers with 3–30 reviews).

- **Day 4 – Enrichment Day**  
  - For the first 100 companies, fill in:  
    - Owner/GM name  
    - Role  
    - Email (from website/LinkedIn/data tools)  
  - Tag at least 30 as “🔥 HOT”.

- **Day 5 – Core City #4–5 or Nearby Suburbs**  
  - Add another 40–60 companies from Maps/LSA.  
  - Focus on trades you most want (e.g., HVAC + roofing).

- **Day 6 – Data Provider Pull (Optional)**  
  - Use Apollo/ZoomInfo/Outscraper to grab 50–100 more that match your filters.  
  - Import and dedupe against your existing list.

- **Day 7 – Cleanup & Prioritization**  
  - Make sure you have **200+ unique companies**.  
  - Tag:
    - 50 “🔥 HOT”  
    - 75 “Warm”  
    - Rest as “Later”  
  - These tags drive your next 2–4 weeks of outbound.

### 6. Quality Standards & Disqualification Rules

To keep your list **high quality** (and protect your time), use these rules:

- **Include** companies that:  
  - Have **5–50 employees** (or look like more than a solo owner).  
  - Are **already paying for leads** (Google Ads, LSAs, Yelp/Angi ads).  
  - Have **3.8–4.7 rating** with 10–100+ reviews (room to grow, but not broken).  
  - Do jobs where **one extra booked job (\$1k–\$5k+) easily pays your fee**.

- **Exclude** (or mark “Later”) companies that:  
  - Have 1–2 reviews or clear signs of being brand new.  
  - Are under **3.0 rating** with tons of angry reviews (may have deeper problems).  
  - Have perfect automation already (online booking + rapid response).  
  - Clearly say “no longer in business” or “temporarily closed.”

The more disciplined you are with **who goes on the list**, the easier it is to hit your demo and client targets with less volume.
