## Daily Ops Playbook – Construction & Services AI Automation

This is your **one-page execution sheet** for landing your first 10 clients.

---

### 1. Non‑Negotiable Daily Targets

- **50 cold emails sent**  
- **20 cold calls made**  
- **5 Loom videos sent**  
- **30 new leads added** to your master list  
- **20+ follow‑ups** (email/phone/text/DM)  

Weekly goal that this fuels:

- **2–4 demos booked**  
- **1–2 new clients closed**

---

### 2. Sample Weekday Schedule

Use this as the default. You can shift times, but keep the **blocks and order**.

- **8:00–9:00 – List Building & Research**
  - Add **10–15 new companies** to your `target-companies-list.md`.  
  - Tag at least **10 “🔥 HOT”** accounts for today (running ads, no online booking, slow response in reviews).

- **9:00–11:00 – Outbound Block #1 (Email)**
  - Send **30–35 cold emails** to HOT + Warm accounts.  
  - Use the sequence from `overview.md` and personalize 1–2 lines based on:
    - Ads they’re running  
    - Reviews mentioning slow responses / missed calls  
    - Lack of online booking on their site

- **11:00–12:00 – Looms & Follow‑Ups**
  - Record **3 Looms** showing:
    - Missed call → SMS → AI intake → booked estimate for their exact trade.  
  - Send Looms to highest‑value accounts and follow up with **yesterday’s opens/replies**.

- **1:00–2:00 – Outbound Block #2 (Email)**
  - Send **15–20 more cold emails**, focusing on trades that are responding best.  
  - This should bring you to **50 emails total**.

- **2:00–3:00 – Cold Calls**
  - Make **15–20 calls**. Start with:
    - People who opened/clicked your emails  
    - HOT accounts with obvious lead flow (ads, LSAs, Angi)
  - Use the script from `overview.md`:  
    “Do you still personally manage booking and quote follow‑up for your jobs?”

- **3:00–4:00 – Demos & Implementation**
  - Run booked demos (10–20 minutes).  
  - Work on onboarding + GHL snapshot builds for any new clients.

If you finish a block early, recycle back into **more follow‑ups**, not less work.

### 3. Lead List Rules (Quality Over Quantity)

When adding to `target-companies-list.md`, follow these standards:

- **Include** companies that:
  - Have **5–50 employees** (or clearly more than a solo owner).  
  - Are **already paying for leads** (Google Ads, LSAs, Yelp/Angi ads).  
  - Have **3.8–4.7 rating** and **10–100+ reviews**.  
  - Do jobs where **one extra booked job (\$1k–\$5k+) easily pays your fee**.

- **Exclude or mark “Later”** if:
  - They have almost no reviews / clearly brand new.  
  - Rating is under **3.0** with lots of angry reviews.  
  - They already have perfect online booking + obvious automation.  
  - They say “temporarily closed / out of business.”

Tagging:

- **🔥 HOT** – Running ads/LSAs, no online booking, reviews mention slow response.  
- **Warm** – Good fit, no obvious automation, decent reviews.  
- **Later** – Very small or early‑stage, or outside top priority trades.

Each morning, build your outbound from **HOT first**, then Warm.

### 4. Daily Tracking Template

Log your metrics in a simple sheet or Notion table with these columns:

- **Date**  
- **New leads added** (goal: 30)  
- **Cold emails sent** (goal: 50)  
- **Cold calls made** (goal: 20)  
- **Looms sent** (goal: 5)  
- **New replies**  
- **New demos booked**  
- **Demos held**  
- **New clients closed**

At the end of each day, fill this in. At the end of each week, review patterns.

---

### 5. Quick Weekly Review (30–45 Minutes)

Once per week (e.g., Friday afternoon or Sunday night), answer:

- **Activity:**  
  - On how many days did I actually hit 50 emails / 20 calls / 5 Looms?

- **Pipeline:**  
  - How many demos are booked for the next 7–14 days?  
  - How many clients did I close this week?

- **Messaging & Targeting:**  
  - Which **subject lines and first lines** got the most replies?  
  - Which **trades and company sizes** are responding and closing best?

Then adjust **inputs, not the goal**:

- Tighten your list filters.  
- Reuse the best‑performing email/subject/loom angles.  
- Double down on the industries that are closing fastest.

Stay locked on the outcome: **10 happy clients at or near full price**. Once that’s in place, everything else (pricing increases, referrals, team help) gets much easier.
