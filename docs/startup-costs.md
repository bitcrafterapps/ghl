---

### 1. One‑Time Setup Costs

These are initial investments to get your offer launched.

#### 1.1 Brand, Domain & Basic Assets

### 2. Core Monthly Software Stack

These are the tools directly tied to delivery of your offer.

#### 2.1 GoHighLevel (GHL)

- **GHL Agency plan:** typically **\$97–\$297/month** depending on tier and features  
  - CRM, pipelines, SMS/VoIP (usage‑based), calendars, automations, snapshots  

**Budget:** **\$97–\$297/month**

#### 2.2 AI / Custom API Infrastructure

Depending on how you implement photo intake and AI flows:

- **OpenAI / similar LLM usage:**  
  - Early stage (few clients, low volume): **\$10–\$50/month**  
  - Scales with the number of messages and photos processed.  

- **Image storage / functions (e.g., AWS, Supabase, Firebase, Vercel serverless functions):**  
  - Early usage: **\$0–\$25/month**  

**Budget:** **\$25–\$75/month** initially.

#### 2.3 Stripe (Payments)

- No monthly fee; **payment processing cost** only:  
  - Typically ~**2.9% + \$0.30** per transaction.  
  - At \$497/month + \$1,000 setup, this is minor compared to revenue.

**Budget:** **\$0 fixed**, fees taken from revenue.

#### 2.4 Outbound & Communication Tools

- **Cold email / outreach platform** (e.g., Instantly, Smartlead, GoHighLevel mail): **\$30–\$100/month**  
- **Email warmup / deliverability tools** (optional if needed): **\$15–\$50/month**  
- **Loom (for video outreach)**:  
  - Free tier is often enough at first; paid plan: **\$12–\$20/month**  

**Budget:** **\$45–\$170/month**

#### 2.5 Data & Lead Sources (Variable)

You can start almost free with manual scraping, but paid tools accelerate:

- **Apollo / ZoomInfo (entry‑level):** **\$50–\$150/month**  
- **Outscraper / PhantomBuster (for Maps/Yelp/Angi scraping):** **\$20–\$100/month** depending on credits  

You can delay this until after your **first 1–3 clients** and start with manual work.

**Budget:** **\$0–\$250/month** (depending on how aggressive you want to be).

### 3. Marketing & Sales Costs

#### 3.1 Cold Email Infrastructure (Domains & Inboxes)

For better deliverability, you may want:

- 1–3 **sending domains** (e.g., `getjobsfortrades.com`, `bookmorejobs.ai`):  
  - Domains: 1–3 × **\$10–\$20/year**  
- 1–3 **Google Workspace / similar inboxes**:  
  - Inboxes: 1–3 × **\$12–\$20/month**

You can start with **a single domain + inbox** and add more as volume grows.

**Budget (initial):**  
- Domains (annualized monthly): **\$2–\$5/month**  
- Inboxes: **\$12–\$60/month**

#### 3.2 Paid Ads (Optional Early On)

Your plan is primarily outbound (email, calls, Loom). You can start with:

- **\$0 on paid ads** until you have:  
  - 2–3 clients  
  - Proven script and case study.

Later, you might test:

- YouTube ads with Loom‑style demo clips  
- Google Search ads targeting contractors looking for “missed call solution”

**Budget (initial 3 months):** **\$0** (test later if needed).

### 4. Example Monthly Budget (Lean vs. Aggressive)

#### 4.1 Lean Start (Months 1–2, Pre 3 Clients)

**Essentials only:**

- GoHighLevel (basic): **\$97/month**  
- AI/API + infra: **\$25/month**  
- Cold email platform: **\$50/month**  
- 1 inbox (Google Workspace): **\$12/month**  
- Loom: **\$0–\$12/month**  
- Data tools: **\$0** (manual scraping)  
- Vercel hosting: **\$0–\$10/month**

**Estimated Monthly Total (Lean):** **\$185–\$210/month**

#### 4.2 Aggressive Build (Months 2–6, After 3+ Clients)

**More automation & data:**

- GoHighLevel (higher tier): **\$197–\$297/month**  
- AI/API + infra: **\$40–\$75/month**  
- Cold email platform: **\$70–\$120/month**  
- 2–3 inboxes: **\$24–\$60/month**  
- Loom: **\$12–\$20/month**  
- Data tools (Apollo + Outscraper): **\$70–\$200/month**  
- Vercel / misc hosting: **\$10–\$25/month**

**Estimated Monthly Total (Aggressive):** **\$423–\$797/month**

---

### 5. Cash Flow View vs. Revenue Targets

Using your financial targets from `overview.md`:

- **Month 1:** \$2k–\$4k MRR target  
- **Month 3:** \$10k–\$12k MRR  
- **Month 6:** \$25k–\$30k+ MRR  

Assume by **Month 3** you have:

- 15–20 clients at ~\$497/month → \$7,455–\$9,940 MRR  
- Plus setup fees collected along the way (e.g., \$10k–\$15k total).

With even an **aggressive tools budget (~\$600/month)**:

- Your software & outbound stack is **\<< 10%** of revenue at \$6k–\$10k MRR.  
- Profit is mainly limited by your own time and any contractors you hire.

---

### 6. Time & Labor Costs (Your Own Time + Optional Help)

#### 6.1 Your Time (Non‑Cash but Critical)

Plan for:

- **Sales & outbound:** 3–4 hours/day  
- **Implementation & support:** 2–4 hours/day (rises with client count)  

This is not a direct cash cost, but a big part of the “real cost” of the business.

#### 6.2 Optional Hires (Later)

Once you reach **10+ clients**, you might bring on:

- **VA or appointment setter** (part‑time): **\$400–\$1,000/month**  
- **Technical contractor** for GHL builds: per‑project or **\$500–\$2,000/month** depending on scope.

You don’t need these for the **first 3–5 clients** if you keep the offer tight and repeatable.

---

### 7. 3–6 Month Cost Summary

#### First 3 Months (Lean)

- **One‑time costs (domain, basic legal, etc.):** ~**\$200–\$800**  
- **Monthly stack (average ~\$200/month):** ~**\$600** for 3 months  

**Total 3‑month startup cost (lean):** **\$800–\$1,400**

Closing **just 2–3 full‑price clients** (\$1,000 setup + \$497/month) easily covers this.

#### Months 4–6 (With Growth)

- **Monthly stack (scaled, ~\$400–\$700/month):** ~**\$1,200–\$2,100** for 3 months  
- Potential **VA or contractor support:** **\$400–\$2,000/month** if needed  

Even at **10 clients** (≈\$5k MRR), you’re still very profitable after tools and light help. At **20–30 clients**, tool spend is small compared to MRR.

---

### 8. Recommendations

- **Start lean:**  
  - One GHL account, one domain, one inbox, minimal AI costs.  
  - Manual scraping + personalization until first 3 clients.  

- **Reinvest early revenue:**  
  - Upgrade data tools and outreach infrastructure once you have proof.  
  - Add more sending accounts and better data to increase demo volume.  

- **Protect runway:**  
  - Keep fixed monthly expenses under **\$300–\$400** until you’re at **\$3k+ MRR**.  

Your goal is to make the **first client pay back your entire 3‑month tool stack**, and then let clients 2–10 fund more aggressive scaling and team support.
