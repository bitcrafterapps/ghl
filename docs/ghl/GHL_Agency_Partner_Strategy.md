# Selling Your Platform to GHL Agencies vs. Keeping It Exclusive

You’ve built a powerful AI-driven SaaS for the construction and home-services industry—including instant website generation, review management, photo gallery CMS, and GHL automation integration. This document outlines whether you should sell your platform to other GHL agencies or keep it exclusive, along with a recommended strategy.

# 🎯 Should You Sell Your Platform to GHL Agencies or Keep It Exclusive?

## 🔥 Overview
Your platform is not a typical GHL template or agency service. It’s a **vertical SaaS product**, and that gives you leverage that almost no other agency has.

You now face two strategic options:

1. **Sell your platform to other GHL agencies**  
2. **Keep it exclusive and dominate your niche**

This document provides a full strategic breakdown of both paths and a recommended plan forward.

# 🅾️ OPTION 1 — Sell Your Platform to GHL Agencies

## ⭐ Why This Is Huge
Most GHL agencies:
- look identical  
- sell the same templates  
- cannot code  
- cannot build SaaS  
- cannot stand out  

Your platform solves all of those problems on day one.

### Your product gives agencies:
- A real SaaS they can white‑label  
- A niche to specialize in  
- Higher perceived value  
- Faster onboarding  
- Better client retention  
- The ability to charge $497–$1,497+/mo  
- Seamless GHL integration  
- AI + CMS features GHL doesn’t have  

This is EXACTLY what top GHL coaches (Kai Stone, Wardrop, Kaplan, Rav) teach—but most agencies can’t build it.

You already did.

# 💸 REVENUE MODELS IF YOU SELL TO AGENCIES

### **1️⃣ White‑label monthly subscription**
$197–$497/mo per agency  
+ optional usage fees  

### **2️⃣ Per-client licensing**
$20–$40/mo per contractor added  

### **3️⃣ One‑time setup + subscription**
$2,000–$5,000 setup  
$197–$297 monthly  

### **4️⃣ Enterprise partnerships**
With influencers like:
- Kai Stone  
- Joel Kaplan  
- Wardrop  
- Rav Sharma  

They could resell or affiliate your platform.

---

# 🎯 WHO WOULD BUY THIS?
- GHL agencies trying to niche down  
- New GHL agencies needing differentiation  
- Coaches wanting better offers for students  
- Agencies wanting their own SaaS  
- Agency owners stuck at $5K–$20K/mo  

This can become a **seven‑figure micro‑SaaS** with the right GTM.

# 🅾️ OPTION 2 — Keep It Exclusive (Your Secret Weapon)

## ⭐ Why This Works
By keeping your platform private, you can dominate the contractor niche without competition.

### Benefits:
- All revenue goes to you  
- No support for other agencies  
- Stronger brand  
- Higher margins  
- Better client retention  
- Full control of your ecosystem  

### Revenue potential:
- $30K/mo with 20–30 clients  
- $100K/mo with 80–100 clients  

Contractor clients are high‑retention and high‑value.

If you want a simpler business, this is the move.

# 🧨 WHICH OPTION SHOULD YOU PICK?

## ✔️ Recommendation: **Do Both — in the Correct Order**

### **Phase 1 — Use It Yourself**
- Get 10–20 contractor clients  
- Gather testimonials  
- Prove ROI  
- Refine UI/UX  
- Improve onboarding  

### **Phase 2 — Turn It Into a White‑Label SaaS**
Once it’s polished and proven, package it as a premium white‑label product for agencies.

### **Phase 3 — Partner with Influencers**
Kai Stone, Wardrop, Kaplan, and Rav are ideal partners.

This is the fastest way to scale to six or seven figures.

### **Phase 4 — Launch the SaaS Fully**
Add:
- Agency dashboard  
- Stripe billing  
- Snapshot templates  
- API keys  
- Documentation  
- Reseller portal  

At this point, you’re building an actual software company.
