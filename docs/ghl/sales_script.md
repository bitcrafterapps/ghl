# Sales Script to Sell Your Platform

## 1. Opener (Cold Call or Cold DM)
“Hey [Name], quick question — are you currently doing anything to automate your lead follow-up or get more reviews for your contracting business?”

(They respond)

“Got it. I built a platform that creates a contractor website in 30 seconds and automates all the stuff contractors hate doing — reviews, follow-up, and content. Can I show you real quick?”

---

## 2. The Value Pitch
“Most contractors lose 40–60% of their leads because no one follows up.  
And most agencies only build generic GHL templates.”

**Your pitch:**  
> “We built the first AI platform made specifically for home‑service businesses. It creates your website instantly, manages your reviews, updates your photo gallery, and sends all your leads into GHL where automation books jobs for you.”

---

## 3. Differentiator Pitch
“You don’t just get a template — you get a real software platform + automated follow-up + review machine.”

Contractors love:
- before/after galleries  
- reviews  
- speed  
- Google ranking  

You give them all three instantly.

## 4. Closing Script
“Let’s get you started. Do you want the Starter plan at $297 or the Growth plan at $697? The Growth plan is what 80% of contractors choose because it increases booked jobs automatically.”

---

## 5. Objection Handling

### ❌ “I already have a website.”
“Totally fine — most of our clients do.  
But their websites aren’t designed for contractors, they don’t show galleries well, and they don’t auto-update reviews.”

### ❌ “Too expensive.”
“What does one missed job cost you? Probably $3K–$10K.  
Our system pays for itself with one booked job per year.”

### ❌ “I’m busy.”
“That’s the whole point — we automate the busy work.”
