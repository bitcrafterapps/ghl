## Pool Service – Existing Customer Automation Map (For Mark)

This shows 5 workflows you can set up for an existing pool service company, focused only on **current customers**, not new leads.

---

### 1. Weekly Route Reminders & “On My Way” Texts

- **Who:** All weekly/bi‑weekly service customers  
- **Trigger:**  
  - Day before scheduled visit  
  - Morning of visit  
  - Tech taps “On My Way” on mobile  
- **What happens:**  
  - Text day before:  
    “Hey, it’s Mark’s Pools – we’re scheduled to service your pool tomorrow between 9–11am. Any gate/parking notes?”  
  - Text same‑day:  
    “We’re planning to be there between 9–11am today.”  
  - Tech taps “On my way” → instant SMS:  
    “Your pool tech is on the way (ETA ~30 mins).”  
- **Value:** Fewer no‑shows/lockouts, fewer “where are you?” calls, happier customers.

### 2. Seasonal Openings & Closings Campaign

- **Who:** All existing customers in your area  
- **Trigger:**  
  - Opening: early spring date  
  - Closing: late summer / early fall date  
- **What happens:**  
  - Broadcast SMS/email (opening):  
    “We’re booking **spring openings** now. Want your usual week? Reply YES and we’ll text you options.”  
  - Broadcast SMS/email (closing):  
    “Fall **closing schedule** is filling up – reply CLOSE and we’ll hold a spot for you.”  
  - Replies automatically move into an “Opening/Closing to Schedule” pipeline stage so the office can confirm times.  
- **Value:** Fills the calendar with predictable work instead of waiting for inbound calls.

### 3. Post‑Visit Review & Referral Engine

- **Who:** Any customer whose visit status is changed to “Completed”  
- **Trigger:** Tech/office marks job complete in GHL  
- **What happens:**  
  - 1–2 hours later:  
    “Thanks for choosing Mark’s Pools today! If we did a good job, would you mind leaving a quick Google review? [link]”  
  - 3–5 days later (if they clicked / gave 5‑star feedback):  
    “Know anyone who needs pool service? If they sign up for weekly service, you both get \$X off.”  
- **Value:** Steady flow of 5‑star reviews and referrals with almost no extra effort.

---

### 4. Equipment Upgrade & Repair Follow‑Ups

- **Who:** Customers who had a repair or have older equipment logged (old pump/heater/filter)  
- **Trigger:** Tag added like “Old single‑speed pump” or “Heater repair”  
- **What happens:**  
  - Campaign 1–2 weeks after the repair/visit:  
    “Quick question – we can usually cut power costs with a variable‑speed pump. Want me to send you a rough estimate?”  
  - If they click/reply, move them to an “Upgrade Opportunity” pipeline and notify Mark.  
- **Value:** Turns one‑off repairs into higher‑ticket upgrade jobs and recurring revenue.

---

### 5. “We Haven’t Seen You in a While” Reactivation

- **Who:** Past customers with no visit in 6–12 months  
- **Trigger:** Last service date older than X days (e.g., 180 or 365)  
- **What happens:**  
  - SMS/email:  
    “Hey, it’s Mark’s Pools – it’s been a while since we serviced your pool. Want us to hold a spot for a mid‑season checkup or cleaning? Reply YES and we’ll send some times.”  
- **Value:** Brings old customers back onto the schedule and back into weekly/bi‑weekly routes.
