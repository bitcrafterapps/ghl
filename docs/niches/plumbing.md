### 1. Plumbing‑Specific Hero

**Headline:**  
Stop Letting Emergency Plumbing Calls Go to Your Competitors

**Subheadline:**  
We install an AI‑powered booking & follow‑up system for plumbing companies that captures overflow and after‑hours calls, books more service jobs, and follows up on estimates automatically — without adding office staff.

**Credibility Line:**  
Built for residential and light‑commercial plumbers handling emergency calls, drain calls, and larger projects.

---

### 2. Plumbing Pain Points to Emphasize

- Emergency calls (burst pipes, sewage backups, no hot water) where speed wins every time.  
- After‑hours and weekend calls going to voicemail and never returning.  
- Dispatchers juggling multiple lines and missing calls during peak times.  
- High‑value jobs (re‑pipes, sewer line replacements, water heaters) getting **one quote and no follow‑up**.

Example line for the Problem section:

> “When a homeowner has water on the floor or a backed‑up sewer, they don’t wait for voicemails — they call down the list until someone answers.”

---

### 3. Plumbing Use Cases for the Solution Section

Tune “What’s Included” for plumbing:

- Missed call → SMS:  
  “Sorry we missed your call — are you dealing with a leak, clog, or no hot water right now?”

- AI intake questions:
  - Type of issue (leak, clog, sewer, water heater, fixture).  
  - Location (kitchen, bathroom, outside, main line).  
  - Severity (small drip vs active leak / flooding).  
  - Property type (home, rental, commercial).

- Automatic booking:
  - Book same‑day/next‑day **service calls** and **free estimates** for bigger work.  

- Follow‑up:
  - Quote follow‑up sequences for **high‑ticket jobs** (sewer line, repipes, tankless heaters).  
  - Review generation after emergency calls.

### 4. Plumbing Results & Example Math

Use plumbing‑specific ticket sizes:

- Service ticket average: \$250–\$700  
- Larger jobs: \$3,000–\$15,000  

Example scenario:

> “If we help you recover just **2–3 extra service calls a week** plus **one big job every month or two**, you’re adding thousands in revenue off leads you’re already paying for.”

### 5. Plumbing Outreach Angles (Email / Loom / Call)

Personalization ideas:

- “I saw you’re running **emergency plumbing ads**, but after‑hours calls go straight to voicemail.”  
- “Your reviews mention **‘had to call twice’** or **‘took a while to get an answer’**.”  
- “We help plumbing companies install a 24/7 backup so emergency calls become booked jobs even when dispatch is tied up.”

Short Loom intro line:

> “Here’s a 3‑minute walkthrough of how we’d catch your next 20 emergency calls and turn more of them into booked jobs automatically.”
