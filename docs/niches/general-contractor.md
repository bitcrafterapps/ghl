### 1. GC‑Specific Hero

**Headline:**  
Stop Losing GC Projects to Missed Calls & Slow Follow‑Ups

**Subheadline:**  
We install an AI‑powered booking & follow‑up system for general contractors that captures new project inquiries, books estimate meetings, and keeps quotes moving — so you win more of the jobs you bid.

**Credibility Line:**  
Built for GCs doing residential/commercial builds, additions, and larger renovations.

### 2. GC Pain Points to Emphasize

- Owner/PMs on job sites, not at a desk answering every call.  
- Inbound calls from Google/word‑of‑mouth going to voicemail.  
- Sub‑contractor coordination, so the office is constantly interrupted.  
- No structured follow‑up on **larger quotes and RFPs**.

Example line:

> “On bigger projects, property owners are usually talking to several contractors. The one who responds and follows up best usually wins — not always the cheapest.”

---

### 3. GC Use Cases for the Solution Section

- Missed call → SMS:  
  “Sorry we missed your call — are you looking for a quote on a new build, addition, or renovation project?”

- AI intake questions:
  - Project type (new build, addition, interior remodel, commercial TI).  
  - Timeline and budget range.  
  - Property type and location.

- Automatic booking:
  - Book **discovery calls** or **on‑site walk‑throughs**.  

- Follow‑up:
  - Sequences for large quotes and multi‑trade bids.  
  - Check‑ins after proposal sending.

### 4. GC Outreach Angles

- “You’re clearly doing larger projects, but there’s no simple path on your site to book a walk‑through or estimate.”  
- “We help GCs make sure every serious inquiry gets a fast response and a chance to book a meeting, even when you’re on site.”
