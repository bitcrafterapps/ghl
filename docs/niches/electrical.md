### 1. Electrical‑Specific Hero

**Headline:**  
Turn More Electrical Calls Into Booked Service & Project Jobs

**Subheadline:**  
We install an AI‑powered booking & follow‑up system for electrical contractors that captures missed and after‑hours calls, books more service visits and estimates, and keeps follow‑up on autopilot — without adding office staff.

**Credibility Line:**  
Built for residential and light‑commercial electricians handling service calls, panel upgrades, EV chargers, and remodel work.

---

### 2. Electrical Pain Points to Emphasize

- Office juggling multiple lines while techs are on the road.  
- Inbound calls for **panel upgrades, EV chargers, and remodels** going to voicemail.  
- No systematic follow‑up on open quotes for larger projects.  
- Safety‑related calls (no power, frequent tripping breakers) where speed and trust are critical.

Example line for the Problem section:

> “When power is out or breakers keep tripping, homeowners don’t wait on voicemail — they move on to the next electrician who answers first.”

---

### 3. Electrical Use Cases for the Solution Section

Tailor “What’s Included” like this:

- Missed call → SMS:  
  “Sorry we missed your call — are you dealing with a power outage, breaker issue, or looking for an estimate?”

- AI intake questions:
  - Type of need (service call vs estimate).  
  - Issue (no power, tripping breaker, outlets not working, lighting).  
  - Project type (panel upgrade, EV charger, remodel, new circuit).  
  - Timeline and property type.

- Automatic booking:
  - Book **diagnostic service calls** and **on‑site estimates** directly into your schedule.

- Follow‑up:
  - Quote sequences for **panel upgrades, EV chargers, and remodel jobs**.  
  - Review requests for completed work.

### 4. Electrical Results & Example Math

Typical numbers:

- Service call: \$200–\$600  
- Panel upgrade / EV charger / larger work: \$2,000–\$10,000  

Example scenario:

> “If you’re currently closing 10–15 service calls a week, catching just **2–3 extra jobs** plus **one panel/EV project per month** can add thousands in revenue without new ad spend.”

---

### 5. Electrical Outreach Angles (Email / Loom / Call)

Personalization hooks:

- “I noticed you promote **panel upgrades and EV chargers** but there’s no online booking option on your site.”  
- “Your reviews mention it’s **hard to reach someone right away**.”  
- “We help electrical contractors capture more of the calls and quote requests you’re already getting, especially after‑hours and when the office is busy.”

Short Loom intro line:

> “In this quick video, I’ll show you how we’d catch your next 15 electrical calls — especially panel upgrade and EV leads — and turn more of them into booked jobs automatically.”
