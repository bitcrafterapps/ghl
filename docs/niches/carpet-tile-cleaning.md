### 2. Cleaning Pain Points to Emphasize

- Seasonal spikes (spring, holidays, move‑out season).  
- Small office teams juggling phones, scheduling, and field work.  
- Leads coming from Google, LSAs, and referrals with **no online booking**.  
- Missed chances to ask for reviews after successful jobs.

Example line:

> “Most customers call whoever can get them on the schedule first. If calls go to voicemail or you’re slow to follow up, those jobs go to another cleaner.”
