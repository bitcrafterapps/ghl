### 2. Roofing Pain Points to Emphasize

- Spikes in calls after storms and hail events.  
- Office overwhelmed during peak season, missing calls and voicemails.  
- Homeowners shopping multiple roofers for inspections and quotes.  
- Slow follow‑up on **insurance claim jobs** and replacement estimates.

Example line:

> “After a storm, homeowners call down the list. If your office doesn’t answer or respond fast, the inspection and replacement go to someone else.”

### 4. Roofing Outreach Angles
