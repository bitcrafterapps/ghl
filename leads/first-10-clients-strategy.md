## Strategy to Get Your First 10 Clients (Construction & Services AI Automation)

This document turns the plan in `overview.md` into a **concrete execution strategy** to land your first **10 paying clients** at **\$497/month + \$1,000 setup** within 3–6 months.

---

### 1. Offer & Positioning (Lock This In First)

**Core Offer:**  
> **AI‑Powered Job Capture, Booking & Revenue Recovery System for Construction & Services**

**Who it’s for:**

- General contractors, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing  
- Mold remediation, water/fire restoration, carpet & tile cleaning  
- 5–50 employees, \$1M–\$10M revenue, already spending on Google Ads / LSAs / Angi  

**Primary Outcome:**  
Recover jobs lost to **missed calls, slow follow‑up, and lack of automation** — **without** increasing ad spend or hiring more staff.

---

### 2. Pricing & Packaging

**Standard Pricing:**

- **\$497/month** – ongoing use of the system, tweaks, light support  
- **\$1,000 one‑time setup fee** – strategy, build, integration, and launch  

**Launch Pricing Strategy for First 10 Clients:**

- **Clients 1–3:**  
  - \$0–\$500 setup fee (heavily discounted)  
  - Lock in \$397–\$497/month  
  - Collect **detailed case studies + testimonials**

- **Clients 4–7:**  
  - \$500–\$1,000 setup fee  
  - \$497/month  
  - Require permission to use anonymized results in marketing

- **Clients 8–10:**  
  - Full **\$1,000 setup**  
  - **\$497/month**  
  - Few small bonuses (extra training, priority support)

Your goal is to quickly move from “discounted, feedback clients” → “full‑price, standard package.”

### 3. Activity Targets (Non‑Negotiable)

From `overview.md` — treat these as **minimums** while you’re hunting your first 10:

- **Daily:**
  - 50 cold emails  
  - 20 cold calls  
  - 5 Loom videos  
  - 30 new leads added to your list  
  - 20+ follow‑ups  
- **Weekly:**
  - 2–4 demos booked  
  - 1–2 clients closed

You don’t adjust the goal based on how you feel; you adjust tactics until they produce these numbers.

---

### 4. 3–Phase Client Acquisition Plan

#### Phase 1 – Foundation & First 3 Clients (Weeks 1–4)

**Objective:** Validate the offer and get 3 paying clients **as fast as possible**, even at discount.

**Key Assets to Prepare (Week 1):**

- `site-content.md` website with:
  - Clear offer and who it’s for  
  - Simple “Book a 10‑Minute Demo” CTA  
- `target-companies-list.md` filled with at least **100–200 prospects**  
- GHL snapshot / minimum‑viable workflow:
  - Missed call → SMS  
  - Simple AI intake  
  - Basic pipeline and calendar  

**Outbound Channels (Week 1–4):**

- **Cold Email (main driver):**
  - Use the Email 1–4 sequence from `overview.md`  
  - Personalize 1–2 sentences based on:
    - Ads they’re running  
    - Reviews mentioning slow response or missed calls  
    - Lack of online booking  
  - Send to:
    - Owner, Partner, GM, or Office Manager  

- **Cold Calls:**
  - Use the script from `overview.md`:  
    “Do you still personally manage booking and quote follow‑up for your jobs?”  
    → Then pitch missed call recovery + AI booking.  

- **Loom Videos:**
  - Record 5 short Looms per day:
    - Show how missed call → SMS → booked estimate would work **for their exact trade**  
    - Drop link in email follow‑up: “Made you a quick 3‑min walkthrough.”

**Conversion Targets for Phase 1:**

- 8–12 demos booked in first 4 weeks  
- Close 3 clients, even if:
  - Lower setup fee  
  - Slightly lower monthly for first couple (e.g., \$397/month)

Deliver **fast wins**:

- Show recovered leads or extra bookings in the first 30 days.  
- Collect screenshots and call/text transcripts as proof.

---

#### Phase 2 – Scale to 10 Clients (Months 2–3)

**Objective:** Use early wins & case studies to charge closer to full price and hit 10 active clients.

**Leverage Case Studies:**

- Turn early client results into a one‑pager:
  - “\{{City}}\{{Industry}} booked 14 extra jobs in 30 days”  
  - Show before/after:
    - Missed calls  
    - Jobs booked  
    - Extra revenue (even conservative estimates)  

- Update **Email 2** in your sequence to reference **real numbers**.

**Refine Targeting:**

- Look at your first 3–5 clients:
  - Which industry responded best?  
  - Who got results fastest?  
  - Who was easiest to sell/implement?  
- Double down on **those 1–2 verticals** for clients 4–10.

**Outbound Rhythm (Months 2–3):**

- Maintain the same **daily volume**, but increase **quality**:
  - Tighter ICP filters (spend, size, reviews, ads running)  
  - More personalized first lines and Loom videos  

**Trial / Guarantee Options (Optional):**

- “If we don’t generate at least **X extra booked estimates** in 30 days, we’ll work for free until we do.”  
- “First 30 days: cancel anytime if you don’t see value.”

Use this only if you’re confident in your ability to implement fast.

---

#### Phase 3 – Systematize & Raise Prices (Months 3–6)

**Objective:** Hit **\$10–\$12k MRR** and turn this into a repeatable system.

- Standardize:
  - Onboarding checklist  
  - Discovery questions per trade  
  - Templates for SMS, email, AI flows  
  - GHL snapshot that can be deployed in under a day  

- Raise floors:
  - Setup fee: **locked at \$1,000**  
  - Monthly: **\$497**  
  - Consider **higher tiers** (\$697–\$997/month) for multi‑location or high‑volume clients.

At 10 clients on standard pricing, you’re at:

- Setup: \$10,000 collected (over time)  
- MRR: \$4,970/month (before price increases)

---

### 5. Pipeline & Numbers (Backwards Planning)

Assume conservative conversion rates while you’re refining:

- Email reply rate: 3–8%  
- Demo booked from replies: 30–40%  
- Close rate from demos: 20–30%  

To close **10 clients**:

- You may need **30–40 demos**.  
- To get 30–40 demos at 30% demo rate:
  - ~100–130 interested replies.  
- At 5% reply rate:
  - ~2,000–2,600 cold emails total.  

At 50 emails/day **(only 5 days/week)**:

- 50 × 5 × 10 weeks ≈ 2,500 emails → **10 weeks** of consistent effort.

You can shorten this timeline by:

- Calling warm leads who opened/clicked.  
- Sending Looms to highest‑intent accounts.  
- Layering in referrals from early clients.

### 6. Sales Call Framework (10‑Minute Demo Flow)

Structure each demo around **jobs and dollars**, not tech.

**1. Discovery (3–4 minutes):**

- How do leads come in today? (Calls, forms, LSAs, Angi, etc.)  
- Who handles missed calls and follow‑up?  
- How fast do you typically respond?  
- What’s an average job worth to you?  

**2. Problem Framing (2 minutes):**

- Estimate jobs lost:
  - “If you miss even **2–3 good jobs a month**, what does that cost?”  
- Tie it to their numbers:
  - “So even one extra \$3k job more than covers the \$497/month.”

**3. Demo (3–5 minutes):**

- Show:
  - Missed call → SMS  
  - AI intake questions  
  - Calendar booking  
  - Quote follow‑up and review request  

**4. Close (2–3 minutes):**

- “Based on what you’ve seen, do you want to move forward with the full implementation?”  
- Present pricing:
  - “Setup is \$1,000, then \$497/month. For my early clients I’m doing **\$X setup** for the first **Y** we bring on this month.”  
- Offer simple start:
  - “We can have this live in **7 days**. All I need to get started is \[payment + access\].”

---

### 7. Retention & Expansion for First 10 Clients

Your first 10 clients are your **case study engine**. Protect them.

- Over‑deliver in first 30–60 days:
  - Extra support, extra tweaks, fast response times.  
- Show them:
  - Monthly report: leads, bookings, estimated extra revenue.  
- Ask for:
  - Testimonials, Google reviews (for you), referrals to peers.  

Potential expansion:

- Add locations or additional brands  
- Increase pricing for higher volume  
- Offer add‑ons:
  - Outbound reactivation campaigns  
  - Referral campaigns  
  - Additional AI/automation workflows

---

### 8. Weekly Review Ritual

Once per week, review:

- **Activity:** Did I hit daily KPIs (emails, calls, Looms, follow‑ups)?  
- **Pipeline:** How many demos booked for the next 7–14 days?  
- **Messaging:** Which emails got replies? Which Looms converted?  
- **Niche:** Which industries are converting fastest and staying sticky?

Then adjust **inputs**, not the goal:

- Tighten your list  
- Improve your first lines and Looms  
- Sharpen your case study email

Stay focused on: **10 happy clients at or near full price**. Once that’s stable, scaling to \$20–30k/month becomes a process, not a guess.

### 9. Daily Execution Checklist (Sample Schedule)

To make this idiot‑proof, here’s a **sample weekday schedule** that hits your KPIs:

- **8:00–9:00** – List building & research  
  - Add 10–15 new companies to `target-companies-list.md`.  
  - Tag 10 “HOT” accounts for the day.

- **9:00–11:00** – Outbound block #1  
  - Send 30–35 cold emails (prioritize HOT + Warm).  
  - Log who you emailed and any replies/opens.

- **11:00–12:00** – Looms & follow‑ups  
  - Record 3 Loom videos for highest‑value accounts.  
  - Send follow‑ups to yesterday’s opens/replies.

- **1:00–2:00** – Outbound block #2  
  - Send 15–20 additional cold emails.  
  - Hit your daily target of 50 total.

- **2:00–3:00** – Cold calls  
  - Call 15–20 companies: start with people who opened or clicked your emails.  
  - Use the call script from `overview.md` and ask for the owner/GM.

- **3:00–4:00** – Demos & implementation  
  - Run booked demos.  
  - Work on onboarding or snapshots for new clients.

You can flex times around, but the order is important: **list → email → Loom → follow‑up → calls → demos**.

### 10. Simple Tracking Template

Use a simple spreadsheet or Notion board with these **daily fields**:

- **Date**  
- **New leads added** (target: 30)  
- **Cold emails sent** (target: 50)  
- **Cold calls made** (target: 20)  
- **Looms sent** (target: 5)  
- **New replies**  
- **New demos booked**  
- **Demos held**  
- **New clients closed**

Once per week, look at:

- Which **subject lines and first lines** generate the most replies.  
- Which **trades and company sizes** respond and close best.  

When you find something that works (e.g., HVAC 5–20 employees, specific subject line), **double down** and let the data, not feelings, drive where you spend your time.
