**Version 1.0 | January 2025**

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a proven, no-cold-call strategy to acquire:
- **10 clients in 7 days**
- **100 clients in 30 days**
- **300 clients in 90 days**

Based on strategies from Kai Stone ($170k/month in 18 months, 9+ clients/day), Robb Bailey (535 clients in 21 months), and other top GHL agency owners.

## Core Philosophy: The Kai Stone Approach

### What Works (Proven 10x Better Performance)
1. **Raw, authentic video content** - Whiteboard videos with zero edits outperform polished ads by 10x
2. **Low-barrier entry pricing** - $297/month disrupts an industry charging $2,000-$5,000
3. **Prove value first** - Let results speak, then upsell
4. **Speak like a human** - Contractors hate feeling sold to; be real

### What to Avoid
- Polished, "Hollywood-style" ads
- Cold calling (businesses review agency partnerships only 1-2x per year)
- Generic, template-based outreach
- High-pressure sales tactics

---

## Pricing Strategy (Disruptive)

### Launch Pricing (First 30 Days)
| Tier | Setup Fee | Monthly | Target |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Early Adopter (1-10) | $0-$297 | $297/mo | Get testimonials fast |
| Growth (11-50) | $497 | $297/mo | Build momentum |
| Standard (51+) | $997 | $497/mo | Full value |

### Why $297/Month Works
- Industry standard: $2,000-$5,000/month
- Your offer: "I'll prove it works for $297 before earning bigger checks"
- This "hit like a sledgehammer" in Kai Stone's words
- One recovered $1,500 job = 5 months of service paid for

---

## PHASE 1: 10 Clients in 7 Days

### Day 1-2: Foundation & Content Creation

**Morning (4 hours): Create Your Video Arsenal**

Record these 5 raw, whiteboard-style videos (no editing needed):

1. **The Problem Video** (2-3 min)
   - "Here's what happens when a contractor misses a call at 7pm..."
   - Draw simple diagram: Missed Call → Lost Job → $2,000 gone

2. **The Demo Video** (3-4 min)
   - Live walkthrough: Call comes in → AI responds → Books appointment
   - Show actual text messages and calendar booking

3. **The Math Video** (2 min)
   - "If you miss just 3 calls per month worth $2,000 each..."
   - Show ROI calculation: $6,000 lost vs $297 investment

4. **The Comparison Video** (2 min)
   - "Here's what agencies charge vs. what I charge..."
   - Whiteboard: $2,000-5,000/mo vs $297/mo

5. **The Proof Video** (2-3 min)
   - Screenshots of actual recovered leads (use demos if no clients yet)
   - "This HVAC company booked 14 extra jobs in 30 days"

**Afternoon (4 hours): Set Up Distribution**

1. Create accounts/optimize:
   - TikTok Business
   - Instagram Business
   - YouTube (for Shorts)
   - Facebook Business Page

2. Set up GoHighLevel funnel:
   - Landing page with demo video
   - Calendar booking (Calendly or GHL native)
   - Automated follow-up sequence

### Day 3-4: Launch Video Blitz

**Daily Video Schedule (2 hours/day creation, 1 hour distribution)**

| Time | Platform | Content Type |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 8am | TikTok | Problem awareness (15-30 sec) |
| 10am | Instagram Reels | Quick tip/hack (15-30 sec) |
| 12pm | YouTube Shorts | Demo snippet (30-60 sec) |
| 2pm | Facebook | Longer form (1-2 min) |
| 4pm | LinkedIn | Business case study |

**Content Formula (AIDA for Short-Form)**
- **Attention** (0-3 sec): "Contractors, you're losing $6,000/month and don't know it"
- **Interest** (3-10 sec): "Every missed call after 5pm = a lost job"
- **Desire** (10-20 sec): "What if AI answered every call instantly?"
- **Action** (20-30 sec): "Link in bio for free demo"

### Day 3-4: Warm Network Activation (Parallel Track)

**The "50 in 50" Challenge**

Reach out to 50 people in your network in 50 minutes:

1. **Text Template** (Personal contacts who know contractors):
   ```
   Hey [Name]! Quick question - do you know any contractors
   (HVAC, plumbing, roofers, etc.) who might be losing jobs
   because they can't answer every call? I built something
   that fixes this for $297/mo. Would love an intro if
   anyone comes to mind!
   ```

2. **Direct to Contractor** (If you know any):
   ```
   Hey [Name], saw you're killing it with [Company].
   Quick question - are you still personally handling
   calls and follow-ups? Built something that might
   help. Can I send you a 2-min video?
   ```

**Referral Incentive**
- Offer $200 cash or 1 month free for every referral that closes
- Referrals convert 3.6-20x higher than cold leads
