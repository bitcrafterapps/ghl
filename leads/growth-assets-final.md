## Video Scripts (Long-Form) {#video-scripts-long}

### Video 1: The Problem Video (2-3 minutes)

**[WHITEBOARD SETUP: You standing at whiteboard with marker]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"Contractors, you're losing six thousand dollars a month and you have no idea."

**Problem Setup (5-45 seconds):**
"Here's what happens. It's 7pm on a Tuesday. A homeowner's AC just went out. It's 95 degrees. They're desperate.

[DRAW: Phone icon with "7PM CALL"]

They Google 'HVAC repair near me' and start calling. First company? Voicemail. Second company? Voicemail. Third company? Someone actually answers.

[DRAW: Arrow to "COMPETITOR WINS"]

Who do you think gets the job? The guy who answered. Not because he's better. Not because he's cheaper. Just because he picked up the phone."

**The Numbers (45-90 seconds):**
"Let me show you the math that'll make you sick.

[DRAW: "Average HVAC job = $2,500"]

Average HVAC repair is $2,500. Right? Now, studies show contractors miss 76% of after-hours calls. Seventy-six percent.

[DRAW: "Miss 3 calls/week = 12/month"]

If you miss just 3 calls a week - and you probably miss more - that's 12 calls a month. Even if only half of those were real jobs...

[DRAW: "6 jobs x $2,500 = $15,000 LOST"]

That's six jobs. Fifteen thousand dollars. Gone. Every single month. Just because nobody answered the phone."

**Agitate (90-120 seconds):**
"And here's the worst part - those customers aren't coming back. They're not leaving a voicemail and patiently waiting. They're calling the next guy. Your competitor. The guy who probably does worse work than you but happened to answer his phone.

You're literally handing him money."

**Solution Tease (120-150 seconds):**
"What if there was a way to answer every single call? 24/7. 365. Even Christmas morning at 2am. And I'm not talking about some answering service where someone takes a message. I'm talking about actually booking the appointment right then and there.

That's exactly what I built. And I'm showing contractors how it works for less than they spend on coffee each month.

Link in bio if you want to see it."

**[END]**

---

### Video 2: The Demo Video (3-4 minutes)

**[SCREEN RECORDING SETUP: Split screen - phone on one side, dashboard on other]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"Let me show you exactly what happens when a contractor using my system misses a call."

**Setup (5-30 seconds):**
"So let's say it's 8pm. You're at your kid's baseball game. Your phone rings, but you're watching the game, you don't answer.

[SHOW: Incoming call, going to voicemail]

With a normal setup, that call goes to voicemail. Customer hangs up. Calls someone else. You lose the job.

But watch what happens with this system."

**Demo - Part 1: Instant Response (30-90 seconds):**
"The second that call ends, within 30 seconds - watch this...

[SHOW: Text message being sent automatically]

The customer gets a text: 'Hey, this is Mike's HVAC. Sorry we missed your call! What can we help you with?'

[SHOW: Customer replying]

Now look - the customer replies: 'My AC isn't working, house is getting hot'

[SHOW: AI conversation]

The system responds - and this is AI, not a person - it says: 'I'm sorry to hear that! We can have a technician out as soon as tomorrow morning. Would 9am or 11am work better for you?'

Customer says: '9am works'

[SHOW: Calendar booking]

Boom. Appointment booked. Customer gets a confirmation. You get a notification.

And this whole thing happened while you were watching your kid play baseball."

**Demo - Part 2: The Dashboard (90-150 seconds):**
"Now let me show you what you see on your end.

[SHOW: GHL dashboard]

Here's your dashboard. Every conversation. Every lead. Every appointment.

You can see:
- Who called
- What they needed
- The full conversation
- The appointment they booked

And look at this - you can see your AI is trained specifically for HVAC. It knows the right questions to ask. It knows how to handle objections. It even knows your pricing and service area.

[SHOW: Conversation details]

This isn't some generic chatbot. This is trained for YOUR business."

**Results (150-200 seconds):**
"Here's what this means in real numbers.

[SHOW: Analytics]

This contractor - HVAC company in Phoenix - they were missing about 40% of their calls before this. Now? They capture 100% of them.

In the first month, they booked 23 extra jobs they would have lost. At their average ticket of $3,200, that's... [pause] ...over $73,000 in recovered revenue. From calls they would have missed.

And what did this cost them? Less than $300 a month."

**CTA (200-220 seconds):**
"If you want to see exactly how this would work for your business, I'll set up a live demo for you. Takes 15 minutes.

Link in my bio. Or just DM me the word 'DEMO' and I'll send you the link.

Stop losing jobs because you can't answer every call."

**[END]**

---

### Video 3: The Math Video (2 minutes)

**[WHITEBOARD SETUP: Clean whiteboard]**

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
"Let me show you math that'll make you want to throw up."

**The Calculation (3-60 seconds):**
"[WRITE: 'Average job = $____']

What's an average job worth for you? Two thousand? Three thousand? Let's say $2,500 to be conservative.

[WRITE: 'Missed calls per month = ____']

How many calls do you miss? After hours, weekends, busy on another job. Most contractors say 5-10 per week. But studies show it's closer to 76% of all after-hours calls. Let's say you miss 10 a month.

[WRITE: '10 missed x 50% real = 5 jobs']

Now not every call is a job. Some are spam, some are tire-kickers. Let's say only half are real opportunities. That's 5 jobs.

[WRITE: '5 jobs x $2,500 = $12,500/month LOST']

Five jobs times twenty-five hundred dollars. That's twelve thousand five hundred dollars. Gone. Every month. Because nobody answered."

**Annual Impact (60-90 seconds):**
"[WRITE: '$12,500 x 12 = $150,000/year']

Annually? That's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Per year. Walking out your door. Into your competitor's pocket.

And that's being conservative."

**The Solution Cost (90-110 seconds):**
"[WRITE: 'AI answering system = $297/month']

Now what if I told you there's a system that captures every single one of those calls. Responds in 30 seconds. Books the appointment. All automatically.

And it costs less than three hundred dollars a month.

[WRITE: 'ONE recovered job = 8+ months paid']

One recovered job - ONE - pays for eight months of the service."

**CTA (110-120 seconds):**
"The math doesn't lie. You're either capturing these calls or you're not.

DM me 'MATH' and I'll show you exactly how many leads YOUR business is missing."

**[END]**

---

### Video 4: The Comparison Video (2 minutes)

**[WHITEBOARD SETUP]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"Other agencies are charging five thousand dollars a month for what I do for three hundred."

**The Industry (5-40 seconds):**
"[WRITE: 'Typical marketing agency: $2,000 - $5,000/month']

If you've ever talked to a marketing agency about lead automation, follow-up systems, CRM setup, you know what they charge. Two thousand on the low end. Five thousand or more if they're fancy.

And most of them lock you into six-month contracts. Some charge thousands in setup fees.

[WRITE: '+ Setup fees: $1,000 - $3,000']
[WRITE: '+ Contracts: 6-12 months']

You're looking at ten grand minimum before you know if it even works."

**My Approach (40-80 seconds):**
"Here's what I charge.

[WRITE: 'My system: $297/month']

Two ninety-seven a month. That's it.

[WRITE: 'Setup: $0 for first 10 clients']

Setup? Zero. For my first clients, I'm waiving it completely.

[WRITE: 'Contract: Month-to-month']

Contract? Month to month. If it doesn't work, cancel. I'm not trying to trap you.

[DRAW LINE BETWEEN]

Why the difference? Those agencies have fancy offices, big teams, account managers. I'm lean. I built the system once. I just plug your business in."

**Why I Do This (80-100 seconds):**
"I could charge five grand. I know the value is there. But here's my philosophy:

I want to PROVE it works before I earn big money from you. If I can show you results at $297, you'll be a client for years. You'll refer your friends. You'll upgrade to other services.

I'm playing the long game."

**CTA (100-120 seconds):**
"So if you've been told you need five grand a month to automate your leads, I'm telling you there's another way.

Link in bio. Let me show you how it works."

**[END]**

### Video 5: The Case Study Video (3 minutes)

**[MIX: Talking head + screen recordings]**

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
"This HVAC company went from missing half their calls to booking 23 extra jobs in 30 days."

**The Before (5-45 seconds):**
"Mike runs an HVAC company in Phoenix. Ten techs. Been in business for 12 years. Good reputation.

But when I first talked to him, he told me something that made me cringe. He said: 'We probably miss half our calls after 5pm. My guys are tired. I'm with my family. We just deal with it.'

Just deal with it. Like losing thousands of dollars is just the cost of doing business.

I asked him: 'What's an average job worth?'

He said: '$3,200.'

I said: 'And you're okay missing half of your after-hours calls? That's potentially $10,000, $15,000 a month walking away.'

He got quiet."

**The Implementation (45-90 seconds):**
"[SHOW: Dashboard screenshots]

So we set him up. Took about two days to configure everything.

Trained the AI on his business:
- His service area
- His pricing
- How to handle emergencies
- When to book, when to escalate

Now every missed call gets a text within 30 seconds. Every conversation leads to a booking or a follow-up. Nothing falls through the cracks."

**The Results (90-140 seconds):**
"[SHOW: Results/analytics]

First 30 days. Here's what happened.

Total missed calls captured: 47. These are calls that would have gone to voicemail.

Conversations started: 41. Six were spam or wrong numbers.

Appointments booked: 23. Twenty-three jobs that would have gone to a competitor.

Revenue from those jobs: $73,600. In one month.

[SHOW: Testimonial if available]

Mike told me: 'I didn't believe it would work this well. I thought it was gonna feel robotic. But customers don't even know they're talking to AI. They just know we responded fast.'"

**The Cost Comparison (140-170 seconds):**
"What did this cost Mike? $297 a month.

Let's do that math one more time:
- Investment: $297
- Return: $73,600
- ROI: 247x

Two hundred forty-seven times return. In month one.

And that doesn't even count the long-term value. Those 23 customers become repeat customers. They leave reviews. They refer friends."

**CTA (170-180 seconds):**
"This isn't magic. It's just being there when customers call.

If you want results like Mike's, link in my bio. Let me show you how it works for your business."

**Q: What if I already have a receptionist?**
A: Great! This covers the 128 hours per week they're NOT working - nights, weekends, holidays.

**Q: Can I customize what the AI says?**
A: Absolutely. We train it on your services, pricing, service area, and how you want to respond.

A: No catch. $297/month, month-to-month. If you don't see results, cancel. We're confident you won't.

**Page 1: The Hard Truth**

You're losing money. Right now. As you read this.

Somewhere out there, a homeowner just called your number. You didn't answer.

Maybe you were on a job. Maybe it was after hours. Maybe you were at dinner.

Whatever the reason, here's what happened next:

They called your competitor. He answered. He got the job.

And you have no idea it even happened.

This guide is going to show you the 5 types of calls you're missing every week - and exactly how much they're costing you.

**Page 2: Call #1 - The After-Hours Emergency**

**When it happens:** 5pm - 9am
**What they need:** Urgent service (AC out, pipe burst, no heat)
**What you do:** Sleep, eat dinner, have a life
**What they do:** Call the next contractor

**The math:**
- You miss ~5 emergency calls per week after hours
- Average emergency job: $500-$2,000
- Weekly loss: $2,500-$10,000
- Annual loss: $130,000-$520,000

**The fix:** Instant response automation that texts within 30 seconds.

**Page 3: Call #2 - The Weekend Warriors**

**When it happens:** Saturday and Sunday
**What they need:** Finally home to deal with that problem they noticed
**What you do:** Try to have two days off
**What they do:** Call whoever answers first

**The math:**
- Weekend calls represent 30% of all home service inquiries
- You're likely missing 80%+ of these
- If you get 20 weekend calls/month, you're missing 16
- At $1,500/job: $24,000/month in lost weekend revenue

**The fix:** AI that works weekends so you don't have to.

---

**Page 4: Call #3 - The Busy Signal Bouncer**

**When it happens:** Peak hours (10am-2pm)
**What they need:** To schedule service
**What you do:** Already on another call or job
**What they do:** Hang up and call next

**The math:**
- 67% of customers hang up if they reach voicemail
- 85% of those won't call back
- Peak hours = your busiest AND most missed

**The fix:** AI can handle unlimited simultaneous "calls" via text response.

---

**Page 5: Call #4 - The Silent Follow-Up**

**When it happens:** After you miss the first call
**What they need:** A callback... that never comes
**What they do:** Find someone else while waiting

**The math:**
- Average contractor takes 24+ hours to follow up
- 50% of leads go to whoever responds first
- You're calling back dead leads

**The fix:** Automated follow-up that happens in seconds, not days.

---

**Page 6: Call #5 - The "I'll Call Back" That Never Does**

**When it happens:** You answer but can't talk
**What they need:** Information/quote
**What you do:** "Can I call you back in an hour?"
**What they do:** Call your competitor who CAN talk now

**The math:**
- 78% of customers buy from the first responder
- "I'll call you back" = "I'm sending you to my competitor"

**The fix:** AI that handles the conversation immediately, 24/7.

---

**Page 7: The Total Damage**

Let's add it up:

| Call Type | Weekly Loss | Annual Loss |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| After-Hours | $5,000 | $260,000 |
| Weekend | $6,000 | $312,000 |
| Busy Signal | $3,000 | $156,000 |
| Silent Follow-Up | $2,000 | $104,000 |
| "Call Back" | $2,000 | $104,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$18,000** | **$936,000** |

Even if you're capturing HALF of these... that's still $468,000/year walking out the door.

---

**Page 8: The Solution**

What if you could:

- Respond to every call in 30 seconds
- Book appointments 24/7/365
- Never miss another emergency
- Follow up automatically
- Stop losing to faster competitors

That's exactly what AI lead automation does.

And it costs less than you spend on lunch each month.

## Demo Call Scripts {#demo-call-scripts}

### Pre-Demo Confirmation Text
```
Hey [Name]! Looking forward to showing you the lead automation
system tomorrow at [time].

Quick question before we chat - roughly how many calls do you
think you miss per week? (After hours, busy on jobs, etc.)

Just want to make sure I show you the most relevant stuff.
```

### Full Demo Script (15 minutes)

**Opening (1 minute):**
"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before I show you anything, I want to understand your business better so I can show you stuff that actually matters. Cool?"

**Discovery Questions (4 minutes):**
1. "Tell me about your business. How long have you been running it?"
2. "How do leads typically come in? Phone, website, Google?"
3. "Who handles the phones? You? Office manager? Receptionist?"
4. "What happens after 5pm? Weekends?"
5. "Roughly, what's an average job worth for you?"
6. "If I said you were missing 30-40% of your calls, would that surprise you?"

**Problem Framing (2 minutes):**
"So let me make sure I'm understanding. You're getting [X] calls per [day/week], and after hours they're going to [voicemail/nothing]. And an average job is worth [$X].

Here's what the data shows - 76% of after-hours calls don't get answered in our industry. And the first company to respond wins 78% of the time.

So if you're missing even 5 calls a week, at [$X] per job, that's potentially [$Y] per month walking out the door.

Does that track with what you're seeing?"

**Demo (5 minutes):**
"Let me show you what this looks like in action. I'm going to call this number live..."

[CALL THE DEMO NUMBER]

"Watch what happens..."

[SHOW THE FULL FLOW]

"So in real life:
1. Customer calls you
2. You're busy or it's after hours, you don't answer
3. Within 30 seconds, they get a text
4. AI has a real conversation - asks what they need, qualifies them
5. Books the appointment right there
6. You get notified, customer gets confirmation

This is running 24/7. Christmas morning. 2am. Doesn't matter.

And it's not some generic robot - it's trained on YOUR business. Your services, your pricing, your service area."

**Value Confirmation (1 minute):**
"Based on what you've seen... does this make sense for [Company Name]? Can you see how this would help you capture more leads?"

[LET THEM RESPOND]

**Close (2 minutes):**
"Great. So here's how we move forward.

For my first [10/20] clients, I'm doing $0 setup - normally that's $297. And the system is $297 per month, month-to-month.

I can have you live within 24-48 hours.

All I need is your business name and phone number to get started. What's the best email for the agreement?"

[TAKE PAYMENT VIA STRIPE]

---

## Objection Handling Guide {#objection-handling}

### Price Objections

**"$297 is too expensive"**
```
"I hear you. Let me ask - what's one job worth to you?

[Wait for answer: $X]

So if this recovers even ONE job you would have missed, it pays for itself
for [calculate months].

And we're offering it at $297 - most companies charge $2,000 to $5,000
for less. I just want to prove it works first."
```

**"I need to think about it"**
```
"Totally understand. What specifically do you want to think through?

Usually it's one of three things - price, timing, or 'does this actually work.'
Which one is it for you?

[Address the specific concern]

The reason I ask is - every day you wait is another day of missed calls.
I just calculated you might be missing $[X] per month. Want to start
capturing those now?"
```

**"Can you do a discount?"**
```
"At $297, we're already a fraction of what others charge.

But here's what I CAN do - let me waive the setup fee for you. That's
normally $297, so you're essentially getting your first month free.

Fair?"
```

### Trust Objections

**"I don't trust AI"**
```
"Smart to be skeptical. Most people picture some robotic voice.

Let me show you exactly what it sounds like.

[Show sample conversations]

See how natural that is? Customers don't even know it's AI.

And you can customize everything - the tone, the questions it asks,
when to escalate to you directly."
```

**"What if it says something wrong?"**
```
"Great question. The AI is trained specifically on YOUR business.

And for anything it's unsure about, it won't make stuff up - it'll say
'Let me have our team follow up with you' and escalate to you.

Plus you see every conversation. If something's off, we adjust it."
```

### Timing Objections

**"Let me talk to my partner"**
```
"Makes sense. What questions will they have?

Actually - are they available right now? I can do a quick 5-minute
overview for both of you.

[If no:] When are you two usually together? I can send a summary
and schedule a quick follow-up."
```

**"We're in slow season"**
```
"Actually, that's the BEST time to set this up.

When busy season hits, you'll be slammed. You won't have time.
But if you set this up now, it's ready when calls flood in.

Plus - even in slow season, can you afford to miss calls?
Every lead counts more when they're sparse."
```

### Competition Objections

**"I already have a receptionist"**
```
"Great for business hours!

But what happens at 6pm when they go home? Weekends? Holidays?

This isn't replacing your receptionist. It's covering the 128 hours
per week she's NOT there.

Think of it as night shift and weekend coverage. For less than
hiring someone part-time."
```

## LinkedIn Outreach {#linkedin-outreach}

### Connection Message (After Accept)
```
Hey [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Saw you run [Company Name] -
looks like great work.

Quick question: how do you handle calls after hours?
Most contractors I talk to are missing 30-50% of those.

Not selling anything - genuinely curious.
```

### Follow-Up (If They Respond)
```
Interesting! [Acknowledge their response]

Reason I ask - I built an AI system that captures those calls.
Responds in 30 seconds, books appointments automatically.

### LinkedIn Post Templates

**Value Post:**
```
Contractors: here's a simple tweak that can add $5,000+/month.

Respond to every inquiry within 5 minutes.

"But I'm on a job!"

That's what automation is for.

The first company to respond wins 78% of the time.

Speed = money.

#contractors #HVAC #plumbing #leadgeneration
```

**Story Post:**
```
Called 10 HVAC companies at 7pm last week.

9 went to voicemail.
1 answered.

Guess who would've gotten my business?

Contractors leave $10,000+/month on the table
because they can't answer every call.

There's a fix for that.

DM me if you want to know what it is.

## Partnership Scripts {#partnership-scripts}

### Cold Email to Partners
```
Subject: Partnership idea - easy recurring revenue

Hey [Name],

Saw your work with contractors - impressive stuff.

Quick idea: I built an AI lead system for contractors.
When you deliver a website, they ask "how do I get more leads?"

What if you could offer them:
- AI that responds to every missed call in 30 seconds
- Automatic appointment booking
- 24/7 lead capture

You get 20% of every client, forever. At $297/month,
that's $59/month recurring. Refer 20 clients = $1,180/month passive.

Worth a 10-minute call?

[Your name]
```

### Partnership Pitch Script
```
"Hey [Name], this is [Your Name]. I sent you an email about
a partnership - did you see it?

Quick version: I built an AI system for contractors. Responds
to missed calls in 30 seconds, books appointments automatically.

I'm looking for partners like you who work with contractors.
You offer it as an add-on. You make 20% forever.

At $297/month, that's $59/month per client. Refer 20 clients
this year = $14,000 annually in passive income.

Want to see how it works?"
```

## Webinar Script {#webinar-script}

### Full Webinar: "How Contractors Are Booking 20+ Extra Jobs Per Month" (45 min)

**Pre-Webinar (5 min before):**
```
"Hey everyone, starting in 5 minutes. While you wait -
drop in the chat: what type of contractor are you?
And what city?

Also: what's your biggest challenge getting more leads?"
```

**Hook (0-5 min):**
```
"Thanks for being here. In the next 45 minutes, I'll show you
exactly how contractors are booking 20+ extra jobs per month
without more ads, more staff, or more hours.

First question: How much money did you lose last month from
calls you didn't answer?

Not calls where they didn't book. Calls that went to voicemail
and you never heard from again.

Most contractors: $5,000 to $15,000. Per month.

That's the $72,000/year problem we're solving today."
```

**Story (5-10 min):**
```
"Let me tell you how I discovered this.

Working with Mike, HVAC company in Phoenix. Spending $5,000/month
on ads. Getting clicks. Website looked great. Close rate was terrible.

I asked: 'What happens when someone calls?'

'We answer if we can. After hours, they leave a message.
We call back next morning.'

'How many answer when you call back?'

He got quiet. 'Maybe 30%.'

70% of his paid leads - gone. Because he couldn't answer
and they didn't answer when he called back.

That's when I built what I'm showing you today."
```

**Content (10-35 min):**

**System 1: Speed to Lead**
```
"First company to respond wins 78% of the time.
Average contractor response: 24+ hours.

You need under 5 minutes. Ideally under 1 minute.

[Demo the instant response]

Watch this - I'm calling this number...
[Show the 30-second text response]

This isn't a template. Watch the conversation...
[Show AI qualifying and booking]"
```

**System 2: Automated Follow-Up**
```
"80% of sales happen after 5+ follow-ups.
Most contractors stop after 1-2. Not lazy - just busy.

[Show automation sequence]

This lead didn't answer for 3 days. Day 4, they booked.
$2,800 job. Without automation? Dead lead."
```

**System 3: 24/7 Availability**
```
"You can't answer at 2am. You can't answer on Christmas.

Average contractor misses 76% of after-hours calls.

[Show after-hours capture]

This conversation: 11:47pm Saturday. Pipe burst.
AI responded in 28 seconds. Booked emergency call.
$4,200 job. Captured while the contractor slept."
