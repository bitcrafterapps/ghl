### 1. Carpentry/Remodeling‑Specific Hero

**Headline:**  
Book More High‑Value Remodeling & Carpentry Projects From the Leads You Already Get

**Subheadline:**  
We install an AI‑powered booking & follow‑up system for carpentry and remodeling contractors that captures inquiries, books estimate visits, and follows up on quotes automatically — so you win more of the kitchens, baths, and custom projects you bid.

**Credibility Line:**  
Built for contractors focused on kitchens, baths, basements, decks, built‑ins, and full‑home remodels.

### 2. Carpentry/Remodeling Pain Points to Emphasize

- Busy season and job‑site work pulling the owner away from the phone.  
- Inquiries from the website or ads getting slow or inconsistent responses.  
- Homeowners requesting **multiple bids** and going with whoever follows up best.  
- No structured follow‑up on open quotes for big‑ticket projects.

Example line for the Problem section:

> “Most homeowners get 2–3 bids. If you’re slow to respond or follow up, even a great price and portfolio can lose to a contractor who just calls back faster.”

### 3. Carpentry/Remodeling Use Cases for the Solution Section

Customize “What’s Included” like this:

- Missed call → SMS:  
  “Sorry we missed your call — are you looking for a quote on a kitchen, bathroom, basement, deck, or other project?”

- AI intake questions:
  - Project type (kitchen, bath, basement, deck, built‑ins, doors/trim).  
  - Timeline (ASAP, 1–3 months, 3–6 months).  
  - Budget range (simple brackets).  
  - Property type and city.

- Automatic booking:
  - Book **on‑site design / estimate visits** into your calendar.  

- Follow‑up:
  - Multi‑touch quote follow‑ups for **high‑ticket projects**.  
  - Upsell and referral requests after completed work.

### 4. Carpentry/Remodeling Results & Example Math

Typical ranges:

- Smaller carpentry jobs: \$750–\$3,000  
- Remodel projects: \$10,000–\$100,000+  

Example scenario:

> “If you close even **one extra \$15,000 project every 1–2 months** because you responded and followed up better, the system pays for itself many times over.”

### 5. Carpentry/Remodeling Outreach Angles (Email / Loom / Call)

Personalization hooks:

- “I saw your gallery of **kitchen and bath remodels**, but there’s no easy way to book a consultation online.”  
- “Many of your reviews talk about your quality, but not about speed of response — we help you win more bids by being first to respond and best at follow‑up.”  
- “We install a simple system so every inquiry about remodels or built‑ins gets an instant reply and a chance to book a visit.”

Short Loom intro line:

> “I recorded this to show you how we’d help you catch and convert more of the kitchen/bath leads you’re already getting into booked estimate visits.”
