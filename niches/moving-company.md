### 1. Moving‑Specific Hero

**Headline:**  
Turn More Moving Inquiries Into Booked Jobs & Full Trucks

**Subheadline:**  
We install an AI‑powered booking & follow‑up system for moving companies that captures inquiries, books estimates, and follows up on quotes automatically — so you win more of the moves you bid.

**Credibility Line:**  
Built for local, long‑distance, and commercial moving companies handling residential and business relocations.

---

### 2. Moving Pain Points to Emphasize

- Seasonal demand spikes (summer, end of month) that overwhelm phones.  
- Customers getting **multiple quotes** and going with whoever responds fastest.  
- After‑hours and weekend inquiries going unanswered.  
- No structured follow‑up on open estimates for larger moves.

Example line for the Problem section:

> "Most people get 2–3 moving quotes. If you're slow to respond or don't follow up on your estimate, they book with whoever calls back first."

---

### 3. Moving Use Cases for the Solution Section

Customize "What's Included" like this:

- Missed call → SMS:  
  "Sorry we missed your call — are you looking for a quote on a local move, long‑distance, or something else?"

- AI intake questions:
  - Move type (local, long‑distance, commercial).  
  - Current and destination locations.  
  - Move date (flexible or specific).  
  - Home size (studio, 1‑bed, 2‑bed, 3+, house).  
  - Special items (piano, antiques, heavy furniture).

- Automatic booking:
  - Book **in‑home estimates** and **virtual walkthroughs** into your calendar.  

- Follow‑up:
  - Multi‑touch quote follow‑ups for **booked estimates**.  
  - Review and referral requests after completed moves.

### 4. Moving Results & Example Math

Typical ranges:

- Local move: \$400–\$2,000  
- Long‑distance move: \$2,000–\$10,000+  
- Commercial move: \$3,000–\$25,000+

Example scenario:

> "If we help you close just **2–3 extra local moves per month** plus **one long‑distance move**, the system more than pays for itself from leads you're already getting."

### 5. Moving Outreach Angles (Email / Loom / Call)

Personalization hooks:

- "I noticed you're running **Google Ads for moving**, but there's no easy way to get a quote or book an estimate online."  
- "Your reviews mention great service, but some mention **slow callbacks** or **had to call multiple times**."  
- "We help moving companies respond instantly to every inquiry and follow up on estimates so you book more of the moves you quote."

Short Loom intro line:

> "I recorded this to show you how we'd help you catch and convert more of your moving leads into booked jobs automatically."
