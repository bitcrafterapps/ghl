### 1. HVAC‑Specific Hero

**Headline:**  
Stop Losing HVAC Jobs to Missed Calls & Slow Quotes

**Subheadline:**  
We install an AI‑powered booking & follow‑up system for HVAC companies that recovers missed calls, books more service and replacement estimates, and follows up automatically 24/7 — without hiring extra CSRs.

**Credibility Line:**  
Built for residential and light‑commercial HVAC contractors running Google Ads, LSAs, and seasonal campaigns.

### 2. HVAC Pain Points to Emphasize

- Summer and winter **peak season call spikes** that swamp the office.  
- After‑hours and weekend **no‑cool / no‑heat emergencies** where callers move on fast.  
- Techs on the road, so the office is stretched thin.  
- Unanswered LSAs and Google Ads calls = **wasted ad spend**.  
- Slow or forgotten quote follow‑ups on high‑ticket jobs (system replacements, ductwork, IAQ).

Example line for the Problem section:

> “When it’s 95° or 20° outside, your customers won’t wait. If your office is tied up or closed, they call the next HVAC company on Google — and that job is gone.”

---

### 3. HVAC Use Cases for the Solution Section

When listing “What’s Included,” call out HVAC‑specific flows:

- Missed call → SMS:  
  “Sorry we missed your call — are you having an issue with heating, cooling, or indoor air quality today?”

- AI intake questions:
  - System type (AC, furnace, heat pump, mini‑split).  
  - Age of equipment.  
  - Symptoms (no heat/cool, strange noise, leak, poor airflow).  
  - Urgency (today, this week, non‑urgent).

- Automatic booking:
  - Book **diagnostic visits** and **free replacement estimates** directly on tech/comfort advisor calendars.

- Follow‑up:
  - Quote follow‑up sequences for **replacement jobs**.  
  - Maintenance plan and tune‑up reminders.

### 4. HVAC Results & Example Math

Use HVAC‑specific job values:

- Average repair: \$350–\$900  
- System replacement: \$6,000–\$15,000  

Example scenario:

> “If your average change‑out is \$8,000 and we help you recover just **one extra replacement every 2–3 months**, the system more than pays for itself. Any extra repairs or maintenance plans are pure profit.”

### 5. HVAC Outreach Angles (Email / Loom / Call)

Use these angles when personalizing outreach:

- “I noticed you’re running **LSAs + Google Ads for HVAC**, but your site has no online booking.”  
- “Your Google reviews mention **‘hard to reach’** or **‘took a while to get a call back’** during busy season.”  
- “We plug in an after‑hours and peak‑season buffer so **no‑cool / no‑heat calls** turn into booked jobs even if your office is slammed.”

Short Loom intro line:

> “I recorded this to show you exactly how we’d catch your next 10 ‘no‑cool’ calls and turn them into booked jobs automatically.”
