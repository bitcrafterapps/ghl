### 2. Pest Control Pain Points to Emphasize

- Homeowners wanting **fast action** when they see pests.  
- Seasonal spikes (spring/summer) that overwhelm phones.  
- Competitors offering online booking and fast callbacks.  
- Recurring service opportunities not fully followed up on.

Example line:

> “When someone finds pests in their home, they don’t wait on voicemail — they call until someone can get them on the schedule.”
