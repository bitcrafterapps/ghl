### 2. Restoration Pain Points to Emphasize

- **24/7 emergency calls** where speed wins every time.  
- On‑call techs or answering services that still miss details or callbacks.  
- Multiple companies being called from Google in rapid succession.  
- Complex coordination with insurance and adjusters.

Example line:

> “When someone has water in their basement at 2 AM, they call until somebody answers. If your team misses that first window, the job is usually gone.”

### 3. Restoration Use Cases for the Solution Section

- Missed call → SMS:  
  “Sorry we missed your call — are you dealing with water, fire/smoke, or another type of damage right now?”

- AI intake questions:
  - Type of loss (water, fire, smoke, mold).  
  - Source and area affected.  
  - Is water still active? Any power issues?  
  - Insurance involved yet?

- Automatic booking:
  - Book **on‑site emergency response** or **inspection windows**.  

- Follow‑up:
  - Check‑ins with property owners during the job.  
  - Review and referral campaigns after completion.

### 4. Restoration Outreach Angles

- “You advertise **24/7 emergency response**, but missed or delayed calls in reviews suggest the phones get overwhelmed.”  
- “We help restoration companies make sure every emergency call gets an immediate response and clear next step, even when your team is already on a job.”
