### Section: The Problem (Why You’re Losing 20–40% of Jobs)

**Headline:**  
Most Contractors Lose Jobs Before They Even Call Back

**Copy:**  
When a homeowner or property manager reaches out, they’re usually calling **3–5 companies**. The one who responds first and follows up best usually wins the job.  

The problem is:

- **Missed calls** when the office is busy or closed  
- **Slow quote follow‑up** when the team is on job sites  
- **No automation**, so everything depends on humans remembering to call back  

If your phones ring during lunch, after hours, or while your crew is in the field… there’s a good chance **20–40% of potential jobs are slipping away**.

And because you’re already paying for leads from Google, LSAs, Angi, and referrals, **every missed call is pure waste** — money out, nothing back.

### Section: How It Works

**Headline:**  
Simple 3‑Step Implementation

**Step 1 – Audit & Design (Day 1–2)**  
We review how leads currently come in: phone, web forms, LSAs, Angi, etc. Then we design your **AI booking and follow‑up workflow** tailored to your services and service area.

**Step 2 – Build & Connect (Day 3–5)**  
We set everything up inside GoHighLevel:

- Call tracking & missed‑call routing  
- SMS templates & AI intake flows  
- Pipelines for new leads, estimates, and jobs  
- Calendars for estimates/site visits  
- Follow‑up and review campaigns  

**Step 3 – Launch & Optimize (Day 6–7)**  
We go live, monitor new leads and bookings, and tune the automation so it feels natural and on‑brand. You get a **simple dashboard** to see how many jobs and dollars are being recovered.

### Section: Results & Benefits

**Headline:**  
Turn Existing Lead Flow into Extra Revenue — Without More Ad Spend

**Expected Outcomes:**

- **Capture 20–40% more jobs** from the same calls and inquiries  
- **Book more estimates automatically**, even after hours  
- **Shorten response times** from hours to seconds  
- **Increase close rates** with consistent follow‑up  
- **Boost Google reviews** and local rankings  

For most contractors, **one extra booked job per month** more than covers the entire system.

**Example Scenario:**  
If your average job is worth \$2,500 and you’re currently closing 10 jobs/month, recovering just **2 extra jobs per month** adds \$5,000/month in revenue — off the same marketing spend you already have.

### Section: Proof & Case Study Snapshot

**Headline:**  
What This Looks Like in the Real World

_Replace this with a real client once you have one; for now you can use a “typical results” style example._

- A mid‑size HVAC company was missing evening and weekend calls from Google LSAs.  
- After installing missed‑call‑to‑SMS, AI intake, and automated booking:  
  - They started booking **more after‑hours estimates** without adding staff.  
  - Their team saw a clear pipeline of new leads, quotes, and won jobs.  
- The owner described it as: “It’s like having a 24/7 dispatcher that never forgets to follow up.”

### Section: FAQs

**Q: Do I need to switch my phone system or CRM?**  
Not necessarily. We integrate with GoHighLevel, which can sit alongside your current tools. In many cases, clients eventually consolidate into GoHighLevel once they see how much it can do.

**Q: Will this replace my office staff?**  
No. This system **supports your staff** by catching what they can’t get to — after‑hours calls, peak times, and follow‑ups that slip through the cracks.

**Q: How fast can we be live?**  
Most companies are live within **7 days**, often faster if you already have clear services and pricing.

**Q: What if the AI says something wrong?**  
We use **tested scripts and guardrails** built specifically for contractors. You approve all messaging, and we monitor and adjust in the first weeks after launch.

**Q: Is this compliant with TCPA and SMS regulations?**  
We build your flows to follow **opt‑in and messaging best practices**. We’ll walk you through the basics and keep things simple.

**Q: What do you need from us to start?**  
Typically just access to your existing numbers or call routing, a short list of services and service areas, and a point person who can approve messaging and see the first leads come in.
