Hi {{Name}},

Quick question --- what happens when someone calls your {{City}}
construction company and your office is busy or closed?

Most contractors lose jobs due to missed calls, slow follow‑up, and no
automation.

We install an AI‑powered booking system that instantly recovers missed
calls and books jobs automatically.

One extra job usually pays for everything.
